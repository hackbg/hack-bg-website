<h2><strong>Cookies Policy</strong></h2>



<p>We understand that your privacy is important to you and are committed
 to being transparent about the technologies we use. In the spirit of 
transparency, this policy provides detailed information about how and 
when we use cookies on our Site.</p>



<p><strong>Do we use Cookies?</strong></p>



<p>Yes. We and our marketing partners, affiliates, and analytics or 
service providers use cookies, web beacons, or pixels and other 
technologies to ensure everyone who uses the Site has the best possible 
experience.</p>



<p><strong>What is a Cookie?</strong></p>



<p>A cookie (“Cookie”) is a small text file that is placed on your hard 
drive by a web page server. Cookies contain information that can later

Some of the cookies will only be used if you use certain features or 
select certain preferences, and some cookies will always be used. You 
can find out more about each cookie by viewing our current cookie list 
below. We update this list periodically, so there may be additional 
cookies that are not yet listed. Web beacons, tags and scripts may be 
used in the Site or in emails to help us to deliver cookies, count 
visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine 
whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports 
based on the use of these technologies by our service/analytics 
providers on an individual and aggregated basis.</p>

<p>Some Cookies are necessary for certain uses of the Site, and without 
such Cookies, we would not be able to provide many services that you 
need to properly use the Site. These Cookies, for example, allow us to 
operate our Site so you may access it as you have requested and let us 
recognize that you have created an account and have logged into that 
account to access Site content. They also include Cookies that enable us
 to remember your previous actions within the same browsing session and

analysis and marketing purposes. &nbsp;Functional Cookies enable certain 
parts of the site to work properly and your user preferences to remain 
known. &nbsp;Analysis Cookies, among other things, collect information on how
 visitors use our Site, the content and products that users view most 
frequently, and the effectiveness of our third party advertising. 
Advertising Cookies assist in delivering ads to relevant audiences and 
having our ads appear at the top of search results. Cookies are either 
“session” Cookies which are deleted when you end your browser session, 
or “persistent,” which remain until their deletion by you (discussed 
below) or the party who served the cookie. &nbsp;Full details on all of the
