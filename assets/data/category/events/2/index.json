Participants will also understand how to apply State Channels and Oracles to develop real-world applications that solve both business and social problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The workshop will be held on 7th June 2019 at Room M1</em></strong> and will be divided into two sessions: one in the morning (starting\nat 11:00), and another in the afternoon (starting at 15:00), each featuring two\ntracks:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Track\n1: æternity Theoretics (45 mins)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first session will feature a brief introduction to blockchain technology, shifting to an introduction to æternity’s protocol, architecture, features, and mechanics. Participants will learn about <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contract </a>programming with Sophia ML, how to use Oracles for real-world data integration, and State Channels for scalability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Track\n2: Building on æternity (2hours)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of the workshop will be dedicated to a practical exercise in which participants will learn how to set up the development environment and initialize projects using æternity’s Dev Suite. Participants will gain first-hand experience in writing a <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/building-voting-aepp-with-sophia-ml-on-aeternity-blockchain/\">simple æpp with Sophia ML</a>, familiarize themselves with the interface, and delve deeper into building æpps on the platform. The track will expose participants to State Channels, smart contract initialization, and execution, and teach them how to implement lists in states, create structures, define and implement logic, test smart contracts, and make use of Oracles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here\nis the workshop schedule:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Session 1</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:00 &#8211; 11:15 &#8211; Welcome coffee<br>11:15 &#8211; 12:00 &#8211; æternity Theoretics<br>12:00 &#8211; 13:00 &#8211; Lunch<br>13:00 &#8211; 15:00 &#8211; Building on æternity</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Session 2</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>15:00 &#8211; 15:15 &#8211; Welcome coffee<br>15:15 &#8211; 16:00 &#8211;  æternity Theoretics<br>16:00 &#8211; 16:05 &#8211; Break<br>16:05 &#8211; 18:00 &#8211; Building on æternity</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The æternity team welcomes all curious\ndevelopers to a journey of exploration of the vast æternity Universe!\nRefreshments will be provided during the workshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come and find out why æternity’s\ninfrastructure is the best solution to the demands of any decentralized\napplication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prerequisite for participation at this workshop is a valid ticket for the <a href=\"https://events.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress/tickets/\">WeAreDevelopers World Congress </a>2019.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Experience State Channel Technology First-Hand—Join the æternity Development Crash Course!

Thanks to all the people that came and our awesome guest <strong>Rali Ralev</strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://weidex.market\">WeiDex</a></strong> we had not only learned cool stuff about Tron but also have had a lot of fun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was by far the funniest and maybe most interactive meetup that we have ever had. I encourage you, future guest and speakers, to be more involved in the meetups, as they are not ours but yours 🙂 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to fill these community events with moments of sharing and learning but also make them cozy and fun. At the end of the day, we are all in the same boat, struggling with the same problems and fighting the same monsters 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let me tell you what have you missed beside the fun if you did not manage to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blockchain Developers News Digest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the first part we had our CEO <strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/milen_radkov\">Milen Radkov</a> </strong>made a quick tour of relevant developers news. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milen started with a last minute call to all teams to update their <a href=\"http://infura.io\">Infura</a> legacy keys before they die on the 27th of March. It turned out to be a useful warning as some devs have missed this incoming major update. Along with the legacy keys, Infura users will benefit after the update from new API Security section that could be found in the dashboard. Infura is also promising premium services coming up soon after the update. So stay tuned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we learned about <strong>Embark 4.0</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you unfamiliar with what Embark is :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Framework by Status</li><li>Out of beta and ready for developers</li><li>Including Cockpit – An intuitive Web Interface<ul><li><strong>Dashboard</strong> &#8211; provides an overview of all processes controlled by Embark (interact with Ethereum, IPFS, ENS, Whisper)</li><li><strong>Blockchain explorer</strong></li><li><strong>Iterative Deployer &#8211; </strong>enables selective deployment of smart contracts to any network</li><li><strong>Code editor &#8211; </strong>contracts even get redeployed as changes are saved</li></ul></li><li>Integrated debugger &#8211; easy way to debug contracts by displaying solidity source codes lines where a transaction failed</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> Milen shared with us the novelties in Truffle v5.0.9 including new multi-chain infrastructure that enables basic Quorum support and debugger improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did not miss to mention about the <strong>Ganache v2.0 &#8211; Chocolate Birthday Cake 🎂    </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>bringing in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>New features<ul><li><strong>Workspaces &#8211; </strong>save your development blockchains in workspaces</li><li><strong>Contract State Decoding</strong></li><li><strong>Event Decoding &#8211; </strong>events that have fired during this chain&#8217;s life</li></ul></li><li>New options<ul><li><strong>Hardfork-</strong> option to change the hardfork. Possible options are: Petersburg, Constantinople, and Byzantium.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Another worth mentioning news was the release of Peter Tsankov’s team of ChainSecuriy &#8211; Soltix. Soltix is a scalable framework for automated testing of Solidity compilers allowing us to test Solidity compiler and EVM automatically. How cool is this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly Milen spoke about the shutting down of Mist and the release of the alpha version of the Playground &#8211; for generalized state channels built with the Counterfactual framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we proceed with <g class=\"gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"8\" data-gr-id=\"8\">Rali&#8217;s</g> presentation we took time to announce our recent <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/events/hack-partners-with-wearedevelopers/\">partnership with WeAreDevelopers</a> world congress and to share with the community the perks we get from it.  You can find out more information on how you can compete to win 2 tickets for <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">the Congress</g>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-892\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is where the fun starts.

Rali covered also the types of Nodes, the Governance mechanism, how one can write Tron Smart Contracts and Tools you can use to help you in your development process. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-2 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"894\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=894\" class=\"wp-image-894\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Rali Ralev, co-founder of WeiDex talking about Tron network</figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"895\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=895\" class=\"wp-image-895\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Rali Ralev, co-founder of WeiDex talking about Tron network</figcaption></figure></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can watch the whole recording of the meetup here:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/whsSoP-_Ga8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Introduction to Tron &#8211; 0x08 [Blockchain Developers Meetup]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, Rali, and thanks to all of you who attended and to those of you who read this post till the end!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wEmk4bronJqNgst_d8BIXzE9Vig8JbUqRYIDDpEaxfA/edit?usp=sharing\">Milen&#8217;s presentation &#8211; blockchain developers news digest</a></li><li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tbeJIu5yaK-9SEdZCv1EzAQBtAuXteui\">Rali&#8217;s presentation &#8211; Tron network</a></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Earlier this week we had our 8th Blockchain Developers Meetup.

What are the benefits? How to develop them and what are they good for? <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milen Radkov had prepared for us some exciting presentation. Let&#8217;s find out!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who could not attend we would like to give you the meetup plan. This time we had 2 parts. On the first <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">part</g> we <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">talked</g> how things in Polkadot work in theory and on the second part we focused on the code and the tools that are doing the magic.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started with the well know to all blockchain developers Smart Contracts functions. When we think about it &#8211; it is really cool that one can write a dApp and push it to the network without permission, knowing that this app will live “forever” without worrying that somebody is going to change his logic, but we all know that the current solutions are not perfect. We are also limited by the computational complexity and the price that we have to pay for it. Not to mention that your code is good to go forever but only on one chain.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p> So what are the alternatives? </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And why are we excited to follow the development of projects like Polkadot.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In Polkadot transactions are unmetered /so you can have extremely complex state transition functions and never have to think about running out of gas/</li><li>Parachains are like building your own blockchain and not have to think about security, because of the shared security mechanism that Polkadot provides</li><li>One can trust the Polkadot validator set that they are securing the chain</li><li>Interoperability &#8211; you can message between all the different <g class=\"gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"9\" data-gr-id=\"9\">parachains</g> /message passing/ async</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second part of the meetup, we deep dived into the code to discover the advantages of using Polakot and Substrate. For those of you who are new to Polkadot, Substrate is a framework allowing us to build entirely new blockchain only in few commands, stepping up on Polkadot&#8217;s development and helping us developers to focus on our business logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-721\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Substrate module example</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>During the code review, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/milen_radkov\">Milen</a> showed us how quick it is to run a custom <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">parachain</g> with a simple betting game ruining on it.

We got out focus on the last minute postponed Constantinople Ethereum fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Constantinople Ethereum fork postponed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As it turns out <a href=\"http://chainsecurity.com\">Chain Security</a>, a company focused on research and security of smart contracts, found a vulnerability that might result <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">to</g> bigger issues and re-enabling <g class=\"gr_ gr_67 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling\" id=\"67\" data-gr-id=\"67\">re-entrancy</g> attacks on some smart contracts after the fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"488\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fork.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-592\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fork.png 488w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fork-300x157.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\" /><figcaption>fork</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Summarizing this &#8211; <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1283\">EIP1283</a> which is introducing cheaper gas costs <g class=\"gr_ gr_163 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"163\" data-gr-id=\"163\">for </g><code>SSTORE</code><g class=\"gr_ gr_163 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"163\" data-gr-id=\"163\"> operations</g> may result in reentrancy vulnerability for some smart contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Contracts that increase their probability to being vulnerable are contracts that utilize a <em>transfer()</em> or <em>send()</em>  function followed by a state-changing operation. An example of such a  contract would be one where two parties jointly receive funds, decide on  how to split said funds, and initiate a payout of those funds.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And the brief explanation: The issue is that when a <code>CALL</code> is made to transfer funds, even if the caller hasn&#8217;t specified additional gas, will spend 2300 gas. <g class=\"gr_ gr_268 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"268\" data-gr-id=\"268\">Solidity&#8217;s </g><code>.transfer()</code><g class=\"gr_ gr_268 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"268\" data-gr-id=\"268\"> function</g> does this and provides no option for the user to override that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this has not been an issue previously, because even though with 2300 gas the caller could make a <code>CALL</code> from the callee<g class=\"gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"20\" data-gr-id=\"20\">,</g><g class=\"gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"20\" data-gr-id=\"20\">but</g> there was no way to change a storage entry <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">when </g><code>SSTORE</code><g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\"> costs</g> 5000 gas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now after Constantinople and the EIP-<g class=\"gr_ gr_35 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"35\" data-gr-id=\"35\">1283</g> the <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">cheapest </g><code>SSTORE</code><g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\"> operation</g> is 200 gas, which opens up a non-zero possibility of <g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">re-entrancy</g> attacks on some smart contracts.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jump Oriented Programming in Ethereum<br></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2250-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-590\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2250-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2250-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2250-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2250-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Exploiting Acoraida Monica game</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As the title suggests it &#8211; the whole topic that we went through is quite catchy. We initially saw this thing called Jump Oriented Programming in Ethereum last month, is quite well explained in a couple of great videos by LiveOverflow in his YouTube channel. So we got in touch with him and Milen Radkov presented this at the meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We saw how we can make a Solidity smart contract misbehave, making it acting different, hiding what exactly is it doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole thing is based on carefully selected function names, and specifically chosen address in order for the execution to succeed (in this case making it possible to withdraw and drain the whole contract).<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/LiveOverflow/21c8a505ca176e5bb20bc94eb23acdf1\">Github repo with all the example code</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozqOlUVKL1s&amp;t=1s\">LiveOverflow video part one</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfL3FcnVbJg\">LiveOverflow video part two</a></li><li>video recording of the meetup coming soon</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Useful links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://meetup.com/blockchain-developers-meetup-bulgaria\">Blockchain Developers Meetup</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg\">Website</a></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Hey you, fellow blockchain developer.
