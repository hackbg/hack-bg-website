In order to do that we will be using <code>forgae</code>.

And <g class=\"gr_ gr_217 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"217\" data-gr-id=\"217\">the </g><code>init()</code><g class=\"gr_ gr_217 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"217\" data-gr-id=\"217\"> function</g> which is the constructor basically, if we compare this to a Solidity smart contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><code>contract Vote =\n   type candidate = address\n   type votes = list(address)\n\n   record state = \n      { vote : map(candidate, votes) }\n\n   public function init() : state = \n      { vote = { } }</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We are defining <g class=\"gr_ gr_263 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"263\" data-gr-id=\"263\">the </g><code>candidate</code><g class=\"gr_ gr_263 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"263\" data-gr-id=\"263\"> type</g> as address, and votes as a <strong>list</strong> of addresses. And the <code>state</code> record will be storing a map (key-value-pair) of <code>candidate</code> to <code>votes</code>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><del>Starting with the first functionality for the aepp &#8211; adding candidates:</del></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><code><del>  public stateful function add_candidate(candidate: address) : bool =       is_candidate(candidate)       true</del></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p><del>What this does is passing the candidate to the </del><code><del>is_candiate()</del></code><del> function &#8211; taking a candidate&#8217;s address as a parameter, checking if there is a candidate defined at with this address and saving it to the </del><strong><del>votes</del></strong><del> mapping in the state with the initial empty list of voters if not.</del><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><del>Here are the helper functions we are using for this:</del></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><code><del>   private stateful function is_candidate(candidate: address) =       let candidate_found = lookupByAddress(candidate, state.votes, { voters = [] })       if (size(candidate_found.voters) == 0)          put(state{             votes[candidate] = { voters = [] } })    private function lookupByAddress(k : address, m, v) =       switch(Map.lookup(k,m))          None => v          Some(x) => x</del></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We are doing this because in Sophia ML we don&#8217;t have a default value of 0x0/false as in Solidity for example. So, in order for us to cast a vote, we need to first have added the candidates which we can vote for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"note\">If we don&#8217;t add the candidate first, before voting, we will hit <code>out of gas</code> error.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next we create the vote function which looks like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><code>public stateful function vote(vote_for: candidate) =\n      put(state{ vote[vote_for = []] @ vs = Call.caller :: vs })</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We access the transaction initiator&#8217;s address by the <g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">built </g><g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\"><g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">in</g> </g><code>Call.caller</code><g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\"> and</g> prepend <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">it </g><code>::</code><g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\"> to</g> the current list of voters.

Some of the points made are also valid for Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) and we recommend them all to take the points into consideration before incorporating IEO as part of their features and services.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8c998-1cfIYEPtDUrSDq9ho3XuBWQ.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) — Pros vs&nbsp;Cons</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Starting with the&nbsp;CONS:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The IEO would be limited to an certain exchange, making it annoying for some investors to participate if they do not own an account in the same exchange. This requires additional KYC procedure and account verification approval time&nbsp;… which leads to the second con</li><li>Also almost any exchange requires KYC, so this is very inconvenient for lots of investors.</li><li>In security matter this approach for funding a project adds an additional point of failure (the exchange).</li><li>Running an Initial Exchange Offering you stumble upon a fundamental problem— a high number of coins are in the possession of very few people, which leads to risk of price manipulations.</li><li>It’s quite easy for big investors to manipulate the price of the token.</li><li>On a traditional centralized exchange, one do not own his private keys, and with exchanges making asset transfers internally (most of them, if not all, are doing this) with no transaction on the blockchain — which leaves the investor with tokens that he does not truly own.</li><li>Scammy projects would definitely want to do an IEO so your token could be listed on an exchange (so its easy for you to dump the coin after the crowdsale).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>The very few PROS of running an&nbsp;IEO:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Its easier for the project to be listed on an exchange.</li><li>IEO adds, in the manner of speaking a sort of protection layer for the investor, as the token is already listed on an exchange.
