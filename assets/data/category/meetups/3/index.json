That’s why we organized a Blockchain Developers Meetup, so that we could involve and pass our knowledge to as much people as we can. Hopefully we inspire developers and enthusiasts to the new disruptive technology — blockchain. We love this topic and we believe it is here to stay, so we intend to make these meetups be “from developers to developers” and share knowledge in our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing knowledge is what this meetup group is for. Blockchain technology is in its infancy, so every bit of new information is very valuable and is helping the community to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our meetup is being held monthly and is focused on the development practices and trends in the blockchain area. It is 100% non-profit oriented and motivated by our love for this topic, our passion for open source, knowledge sharing, constant learning, meeting new people and having fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can visit our meetup page and be part of our community as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-meetup-com wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-meetup\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<style type=\"text/css\">#meetup_oembed .mu_clearfix:after { visibility: hidden; display: block; font-size: 0; content: \" \"; clear: both; height: 0; }* html #meetup_oembed .mu_clearfix, *:first-child+html #meetup_oembed .mu_clearfix { zoom: 1; }#meetup_oembed { background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:10px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;border-radius:3px;margin:0; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; }#meetup_oembed h3 { font-weight:normal; margin:0 0 10px; padding:0; line-height:26px; font-family:Georgia,Palatino,serif; font-size:24px }#meetup_oembed p { margin: 0 0 10px; padding:0; line-height:16px; }#meetup_oembed img { border:none; margin:0; padding:0; }#meetup_oembed a, #meetup_oembed a:visited, #meetup_oembed a:link { color: #1B76B3; text-decoration: none; cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; }#meetup_oembed a:hover { color: #1B76B3; text-decoration: underline; }#meetup_oembed a.mu_button { font-size:14px; -moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;border-radius:3px;border:2px solid #A7241D;color:white!important;text-decoration:none;background-color: #CA3E47; background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #ca3e47, #a8252e); background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, left bottom, left top, color-stop(0, #a8252e), color-stop(1, #ca3e47));disvplay:inline-block;padding:5px 10px; }#meetup_oembed a.mu_button:hover { color: #fff!important; text-decoration: none; }#meetup_oembed .photo { width:50px; height:50px; overflow:hidden;background:#ccc;float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;text-align:center;padding:1px; }#meetup_oembed .photo img { height:50px }#meetup_oembed .number { font-size:18px; }#meetup_oembed .thing { text-transform: uppercase; color: #555; }</style><div id=\"meetup_oembed\" style=\"height:335px\">     <div style=\"overflow:hidden;max-height:295px\">          <h3>Blockchain Developers Meetup (Bulgaria)</h3>          <p style=\"margin:0 0 10px;font-size:12px;line-height:16px;\">Sofia, BG <br />          <span style=\"font-size:14px;font-weight:bold;\">129</span> <em>Developers</em></p>          <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain-Developers-Meetup-Bulgaria/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/a/7/600_472464743.jpeg\" style=\"float:right;max-width:150px;margin-right:0;\" /></a>                          <div style=\"margin-right:170px;line-height:16px;\">In this group, we will share knowledge about blockchain and smart contract development.
