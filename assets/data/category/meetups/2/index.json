Thanks to all the people that came and our awesome guest <strong>Rali Ralev</strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://weidex.market\">WeiDex</a></strong> we had not only learned cool stuff about Tron but also have had a lot of fun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was by far the funniest and maybe most interactive meetup that we have ever had. I encourage you, future guest and speakers, to be more involved in the meetups, as they are not ours but yours 🙂 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to fill these community events with moments of sharing and learning but also make them cozy and fun. At the end of the day, we are all in the same boat, struggling with the same problems and fighting the same monsters 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let me tell you what have you missed beside the fun if you did not manage to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blockchain Developers News Digest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the first part we had our CEO <strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/milen_radkov\">Milen Radkov</a> </strong>made a quick tour of relevant developers news. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milen started with a last minute call to all teams to update their <a href=\"http://infura.io\">Infura</a> legacy keys before they die on the 27th of March. It turned out to be a useful warning as some devs have missed this incoming major update. Along with the legacy keys, Infura users will benefit after the update from new API Security section that could be found in the dashboard. Infura is also promising premium services coming up soon after the update. So stay tuned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we learned about <strong>Embark 4.0</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you unfamiliar with what Embark is :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Framework by Status</li><li>Out of beta and ready for developers</li><li>Including Cockpit – An intuitive Web Interface<ul><li><strong>Dashboard</strong> &#8211; provides an overview of all processes controlled by Embark (interact with Ethereum, IPFS, ENS, Whisper)</li><li><strong>Blockchain explorer</strong></li><li><strong>Iterative Deployer &#8211; </strong>enables selective deployment of smart contracts to any network</li><li><strong>Code editor &#8211; </strong>contracts even get redeployed as changes are saved</li></ul></li><li>Integrated debugger &#8211; easy way to debug contracts by displaying solidity source codes lines where a transaction failed</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> Milen shared with us the novelties in Truffle v5.0.9 including new multi-chain infrastructure that enables basic Quorum support and debugger improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did not miss to mention about the <strong>Ganache v2.0 &#8211; Chocolate Birthday Cake 🎂    </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>bringing in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>New features<ul><li><strong>Workspaces &#8211; </strong>save your development blockchains in workspaces</li><li><strong>Contract State Decoding</strong></li><li><strong>Event Decoding &#8211; </strong>events that have fired during this chain&#8217;s life</li></ul></li><li>New options<ul><li><strong>Hardfork-</strong> option to change the hardfork. Possible options are: Petersburg, Constantinople, and Byzantium.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Another worth mentioning news was the release of Peter Tsankov’s team of ChainSecuriy &#8211; Soltix. Soltix is a scalable framework for automated testing of Solidity compilers allowing us to test Solidity compiler and EVM automatically. How cool is this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly Milen spoke about the shutting down of Mist and the release of the alpha version of the Playground &#8211; for generalized state channels built with the Counterfactual framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we proceed with <g class=\"gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"8\" data-gr-id=\"8\">Rali&#8217;s</g> presentation we took time to announce our recent <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/events/hack-partners-with-wearedevelopers/\">partnership with WeAreDevelopers</a> world congress and to share with the community the perks we get from it.  You can find out more information on how you can compete to win 2 tickets for <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">the Congress</g>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-892\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is where the fun starts.

Rali covered also the types of Nodes, the Governance mechanism, how one can write Tron Smart Contracts and Tools you can use to help you in your development process. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-2 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"894\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=894\" class=\"wp-image-894\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Rali Ralev, co-founder of WeiDex talking about Tron network</figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"895\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=895\" class=\"wp-image-895\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Rali Ralev, co-founder of WeiDex talking about Tron network</figcaption></figure></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can watch the whole recording of the meetup here:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/whsSoP-_Ga8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Introduction to Tron &#8211; 0x08 [Blockchain Developers Meetup]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, Rali, and thanks to all of you who attended and to those of you who read this post till the end!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wEmk4bronJqNgst_d8BIXzE9Vig8JbUqRYIDDpEaxfA/edit?usp=sharing\">Milen&#8217;s presentation &#8211; blockchain developers news digest</a></li><li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tbeJIu5yaK-9SEdZCv1EzAQBtAuXteui\">Rali&#8217;s presentation &#8211; Tron network</a></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Earlier this week we had our 8th Blockchain Developers Meetup.

When we think about it &#8211; it is really cool that one can write a dApp and push it to the network without permission, knowing that this app will live “forever” without worrying that somebody is going to change his logic, but we all know that the current solutions are not perfect.

We were honored to have <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ivshti\">Ivo</a> from <a href=\"http://adex.network\">AdEx</a> walking us through their Polkadot Substrate implementation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2068-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-572\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2068-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2068-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2068-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2068-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Ivo Georgiev (AdEx) presenting their substrate implementation</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who were not with us at the event, I&#8217;d like to share with you some details. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first part we discussed Polkadot&#8217;s past, present and future development and then we left the stage to Ivo to show us more about his work in code.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Past</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To get to know what really Polkadot is doing and what it is trying to achieve we collected some data. And as we can see the team has come a long way in a very short period of time. In only thirteen months the team managed to deliver over 68,000 lines of core code and more than 100k lines altogether. They have launched several testnets each of them to support and test all new features. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Present</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><g class=\"gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"7\" data-gr-id=\"7\">Currently</g> the team has been working on 1.0 beta of the third generation of <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">blockchain</g> technology stack, Substate. Another cool thing that Polkdot&#8217;s team has been working on is the release of “Alexander” test net. The team is considering this their third major milestone. “Alexander” test net is important because it&#8217;s going to feature the audit-ready GRANDPA finalization algorithm, an overhaul to the cryptography and further improved governance logic including lock-voting and delayed-enactment.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the previous development the team is already ahead of schedule but <g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">nevertheless</g> there is one more key milestone to reach: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ICMP or, to the uninitiated, Inter-Chain Message Passing. scheduled to happen over the first three months of 2019, with a test net incorporating it, scheduled to be launched in April. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-575\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption> Milen Radkov talking at polkadot sofia</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Simultaneously, the team has been <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">finalising</g> the “nominated proof-of-stake” scheme and building in <g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">parachain</g> consensus into Substrate, allowing Substrate chains to plug <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">in to</g> the global blockchain network that is Polkadot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this is done and the key features are implemented, there’s going to be a period of around six months of extensive testing before we can see the launch of Polkadot 1.0. Uhhuu, Exciting future for blockchain technology.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After learning a bit more about the project and its goals we had to see some code, to understand it&#8217;s full power.

Moreover, we are happy to see new faces in the rows and to see our community growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/2b818-1YBU7COOCqWsP6CSpe2E5Wg.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Blockchain Developers Meetup Bulgaria — 04</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This time we had a small technical issue, the youtube live stream crashed a few times and we were unable to fix it on time, so we couldn’t record the whole session and we would like to apologize for that to the people watching us online. In this post, we will share with you the essence of yesterday’s meet-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The event went as follows.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>In the first&nbsp;part</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We covered crypto related news covering Forks, Security, and technology advancements, without going into many technical details. In the second part we have our fantastic speaker <a href=\"https://pmihaylov.com/\" data-href=\"https://pmihaylov.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Preslav Mihaylov</strong></a>, head of blockchain training at <a href=\"https://softuni.bg\" data-href=\"https://softuni.bg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Software University</a> (SoftUni Sofia), introduce the public to <strong>Solidity Assembly</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look more into the details&nbsp;…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our CEO <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/23eaffb29922\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/u/23eaffb29922\" data-anchor-type=\"2\" data-user-id=\"23eaffb29922\" data-action-value=\"23eaffb29922\" data-action=\"show-user-card\" data-action-type=\"hover\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Milen Radkov</a> went to meet with some cool guys at <a href=\"https://websummit.com\" data-href=\"https://websummit.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Web Summit</strong></a> in Lisbon, so this time our Business Development Manager Hristo led the party — it was about time someone else to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spoke about the recently released <strong>Cardano Rust Project,</strong> which is basically an API allowing third-party developers to dive into <a href=\"https://www.cardano.org/en/home/\" data-href=\"https://www.cardano.org/en/home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cardano</a>. It is worth mentioning that the project is a toolkit compatible for iOS, Web, and Android.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we discussed the rise of the <strong>Bitcoin</strong> <strong>sidechains</strong> with the release of <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/liquid/\" data-href=\"https://blockstream.com/liquid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blockstream’s Liquid Network</a>. An alternative to the <strong>Lightning network </strong>but with focus on exchanges and the big financial institutions(worth having a look at).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did not miss to mention the unsuccessful release of Constantinople Hard Fork that did not manage to sync after launch with the Testnet. Few reasons were mentioned by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/5chdn\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/5chdn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Afri Schoedon</a>, Parity dev and the takeaway is that the fork will be delayed until sometime in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we looked at a rather worrisome report saying that over 54% of the 100 top daily volume exchanges have security issues. And the most common issues are related to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Console errors</li><li>User Account Security</li><li>Registar and Domain Security</li><li>Web Protocol Security</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Next topic was the exiting release of Sapling, Zcash hard fork allowing shielded transfers to be completed with 100 times less memory (around 40mb) and probably six or more times faster. With this upgrade Zcash confidential transactions are getting mobile friendly because one does not need to run a full node anymore to run them. Zcash are bringing to us their awesome technology that will lead to us to the era of “privacy-by-default”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before the end of the news review, we mentioned the first Truckload Shipment Using Bitcoin Smart Contracts with Rootstock (RSK). During the shipment, the Funds for the transaction were held in escrow by the smart contract on the integrated RSK platform and were automatically released to the carrier upon delivery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly, we discussed a recent EOS report pointing out the EOS has misled the public on the number of transaction that it can handle. The study was funded by the Bounties Network which is led by Brent Xu of ConsenSys and for this purpose replicated the EOS network to analyze its performance during two months of testing. The conclusions it reached are fairly damning. They say, for example:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>— “EOS is not a blockchain, rather a distributed homogeneous database management system, a clear distinction in that their transactions are not cryptographically validated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>— “The performance metrics observed when factors such as real-world network latency and packet loss are implemented indicate that TPS in EOS approaches levels comparable to Ethereum.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>— Various forms of consensus failure were shown in the network testing. Consensus is entirely dependent upon the voting mechanism which is based on social consensus, not algorithmic BFT consensus.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Getting more technical</h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a6980-12CAfLFUMbeGI-hVp3_cd0w.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Preslav Mihaylov</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into Assembly, Preslav gave to the audience an overview of Assembly Language and the Programming Language Types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed what are the advantages and the disadvantages of Compiled Languages over Interpreted Languages VM based Languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also looked at how they actually work:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ea65c-10AtGU2tDpnSaIwwClCkQgw.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>from assembly via Assembler directly to Machine&nbsp;code</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/9878f-1JfdOizhMyyJuRmXL-Yk_Dw.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Compiled Languages — Best Performance/ Lack of portability</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/33b93-1diwTxtzARUa00gyLjmzc8w.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Comfortable high-level features/ Worst Performance</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/668ba-1GKLDAUFVWXjyoE4U7xlV2A.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>a mix between compiled and interpreted languages</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discussed how the EVM is working and what are its benefits</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a4a23-1KZIljUvcBOiH4fhCb8-HlA.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>platform independent</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Preslav explained the benefits of using Solidity Assembly, but also did not miss to explain the risks related to using it. Using Assembly to achieve features that are not yet introduced into Solidity can come to a high price if one messes up the opcode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Live Demo, we have been introduced to Basic Operations in Assembly aiming to boost developers confidence when they encounter Assembly at work.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ac280-1Ox5mVFGc1rkUEct4y-ypUw.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Basic operations in&nbsp;Assembly</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/76c77-1gqbWtp2FZIAu_wK7wPNbyA.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>using jump to implement for loop in&nbsp;Assembly</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>At the last part of Preslav&#8217;s presentation, we discussed the different types of memory in the EVM and their particularities.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Looking forward to meeting you on our next&nbsp;meetup.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you liked this article don&#8217;t hesitate to follow us on Medium.
