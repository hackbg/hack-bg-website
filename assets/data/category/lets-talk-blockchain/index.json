The main distinguishing features of them are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>They improve on older cryptocurrencies by placing privacy at the core of their new design</li><li>They aren’t backward compatible since they’re a whole new cryptocurrency</li><li>They have inherently higher complexity</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, so good. Those new privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies sound like a nice deal, what are some real-world examples then? Well, let’s point out the most prominent ones and then analyze them closer. We’ll be scratching on Zerocoin, Zerocash, and Monero.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zerocoin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one, <a href=\"http://zerocoin.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Zerocoin</a>, is more of a protocol-oriented project. Quoting its creators as to what its aim is: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Zerocoin is a project to fix a major weakness in Bitcoin: the lack of privacy guarantees we take for granted in using credit cards and cash. Our goal is to build a cryptocurrency where your neighbors, friends, and enemies can’t see what you bought or for how much.</p><cite>Zerocoin website</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This very cool statement is backed by the mixing capability implemented in the <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6547123\" class=\"rank-math-link\">protocol</a> itself. Now, let’s open  Zerocoin’s hatch and see how its gears turn. The main idea is that there are two types of coins &#8211; a Basecoin (Bitcoin or some other altcoin) and a Zerocoin which serves as an extension of the Basecoin. Basecoins can be swapped for Zerocoins and vice versa. If you go back to the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/lets-talk-blockchain/cryptocurrencies-and-privacy/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">first part</a> of this post, you will see that this serves pretty much the same purpose as coin mixing and it aims to remove the linkability of the initial Basecoins. You can find a rough visualization of what happens when using only the Basecoin vs Basecoin + Zerocoin. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-1024x333.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3116\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-1024x333.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-300x97.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-768x250.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-1536x499.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-1038x337.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability.png 1828w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Transaction linkability of a Basecoin(BTC) vs. Zerocoin</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea consists of two parts: initially, a user converts a Basecoin into a Zerocoin, and then, in the future, the same user can use the Zerocoin to turn it back into a Basecoin. The protocol guarantees a curious user can’t find out exactly which Zerocoin was used to create a Basecoin, hence the initial “creator” of the Zerocoin can’t be linked. The first part (minting) is achieved through a classical cryptographic commitment. To mint a Zerocoin, a user must generate a serial number <strong><em>S</em></strong> which will be used in the future to spend the Zerocoin (this prevents double-spending), and a random secret <strong><em>r</em></strong> which must remain private (this enforces the unlinkability when spending). The commitment then is calculated as <em><strong>c := g^(S) * h^(r)</strong> </em>(<strong><em>g</em></strong> and <strong><em>h</em></strong> being hash functions) which ensures that neither <strong><em>S</em></strong> nor <strong><em>r</em></strong> can be computed by only knowing the commitment <strong><em>c</em></strong>. Once this is done, a user posts the commitment together with the hash of the Basecoin which they wish to convert to Zerocoin, and if the Basecoin is owned by them, then the minting transaction is accepted and posted on the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"272\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-1024x272.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3117\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-1024x272.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-300x80.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-768x204.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-1536x408.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-1038x275.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing.png 1828w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Zerocoin minting process</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, unlinkability hasn’t been achieved. This is done in the second part (spending). To accomplish this, the protocol utilizes several techniques, one of which is an accumulator. A closer look at how accumulators operate is shown below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"642\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-1024x642.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3118\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-1024x642.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-300x188.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-768x481.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-919x576.png 919w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Basic overview of an accumulator function</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, the accumulator in the Zerocoin protocol is used for accumulating every mint transaction on the blockchain as part of the spending phase. So, after this slight technical detour, let’s look at how Alice can spend her Zerocoins while maintaining unlinkability.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Firstly, she would have to publish the serial number <strong><em>S</em></strong> she generated at the minting phase &#8211; remember that <strong><em>c := g^(S) * h^(r)</em></strong> </li><li>Then, she should accumulate all previously minted Zerocoins (their commitments) on the blockchain &#8211; <strong><em>a</em></strong></li><li>After that, Alice will compute the public witness <strong><em>w</em></strong> for her coin</li><li>Lastly, she must create a ZKP stating that &#8220;she knows a random secret <strong><em>r</em></strong> such that a coin <strong><em>c</em></strong> is one of the minted Zerocoins”. She keeps <strong><em>r</em></strong> and <strong><em>c</em></strong> secret, of course. <br><br>The ZKP is the interesting part since it uses a logical disjunction of ZKPs for all of the Zerocoins and the whole ZKP is evaluated as true if one ZKP is valid while not revealing exactly which ZKP is valid.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-1024x577.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3119\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-1024x577.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-768x433.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-1023x576.png 1023w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Process of computing a disjunction of ZKPs</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the protocol itself doesn’t guarantee absolute unlinkability if used poorly. For once, if there are only a few people using Zerocoins, then the overall ZKP from step 4 would result in very fragile unlinkability. Another point of failure is user habits. The effectiveness of the protocol depends on the users making smart decisions, meaning that if a single user mints a Zerocoin from one address and then simply spends a Zerocoin from the same address, nothing is achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zerocash</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you visit Zerocoin’s official website, you will see the information that the protocol has been succeeded by a fully functional project called <a href=\"https://z.cash/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Zerocash</a>. So, what are the improvements?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main change is that Zerocash runs on its own and doesn’t need a Basecoin to function. Additionally, it relies on better cryptographic proof techniques (zk-SNARKs). At its core, Zerocash makes use of the notion that there are 2 address types &#8211; private (z-addresses) and transparent (t-addresses) ones which allow 4 different transaction types.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-1024x375.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3120\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-1024x375.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-300x110.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-768x281.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-1038x380.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Zcash transaction types</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The most interesting of these 4 transaction types If the Z-to-Z transaction which quoting Zerocash’s website is specified as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>A Z-to-Z transaction appears on the public blockchain, so it is known to have occurred and that the fees were paid. But the addresses, transaction amount, and the memo field are all encrypted and not publicly visible. This type of encryption is only possible through the use of zero-knowledge proofs.<br>The owner of an address may choose to disclose z-address and transaction details with trusted third parties — think auditory and compliance needs — through the use of view keys and payment disclosure.</p><cite>Zerocash website</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, Zerocash looks better than Zerocoin, but it also has some drawbacks. The main one being the inherent need for a secret random input needed to generate public parameters during the setup phase and the importance of these inputs being securely destroyed. The reason for this is if someone gets ahold of those secrets, then that person could <a href=\"http://zerocash-project.org/q_and_a#can-one-put-a-backdoor-in-zerocash\" class=\"rank-math-link\">forge</a> coins arbitrarily. This hasn’t happened yet, so we can assume the system has been safe so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Monero</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if we are looking for a cryptocurrency that is even stricter when it comes to privacy. How about something along these lines:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It’s a set of open-source privacy-focused protocols that were initially built upon Bytecoin/CryptoNode code</li><li>There’s an accepted hard-fork approximately twice a year used as a testing environment for new functions</li><li>The community interest is increasing constantly and it’s very well maintained</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, this is <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Monero</a> for you. It has its roots in this famous bitcointalk forum <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563821.0\" class=\"rank-math-link\">thread</a>. Nowadays, Monero developers have implemented several very important features that make the cryptocurrency arguably the best privacy-oriented one out there: it provides stealth addresses which aren’t the typical public addresses as in other cryptos, the transaction information is confidential meaning the transacted amounts aren&#8217;t publicly visible, and it utilizes ring signatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at the first feature, <strong><em>stealth addresses</em></strong>. Most cryptocurrencies promote the usage of a new address for every payment, however, this has often proven to be ineffective in maintaining privacy. Firstly, due to the work in modern heuristics that aim to link addresses and secondly, because at some point one user has to communicate an address to another user or service. This is why Monero tackled this problem by creating a new address management system. Stealth addresses function by allowing a user to post a general public “STEALTHADDR” which other users can use as a blueprint to create arbitrarily many different addresses and send coins to them. These coins will be accessible only by the user holding the private key to the blueprint “STEALTHADDR”. This way, a curious user can’t link different fresh addresses to the initial “STEALTHADDR”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The math behind this isn’t too complex. Let’s say Alice creates a pair of private keys &#8211; <em><strong>(a, b)</strong></em> and publishes a pair of public keys &#8211; <em><strong>(g^a, g^b)</strong></em>. After that, Bob can use those public keys to create as many fresh addresses as he wants and send money to Alice through those. For a new address, Bob generates a private random secret <strong><em>r</em></strong>, computes <strong><em>f = g^(a * r)</em></strong>, and then the new address would be <strong><em>P = g^(H(f)) * g^b</em></strong>. When sending coins, Bob also includes <strong><em>g^r</em></strong>. Now, Alice can compute the private key <strong><em>p</em></strong> for the new address <strong><em>P</em></strong> simply by calculating <strong><em>p = H(g^(a * r)) + b</em></strong> and spend the coins.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"249\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-1024x249.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3135\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-1024x249.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-300x73.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-768x187.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-1038x253.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Stealth addresses</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The next important feature is <strong><em>confidential transactions</em></strong>. Monero has correctly focused on hiding the transacted amount because that piece of information is quite heavily utilized in modern linking heuristic methods. This is achieved via the homomorphic property of commitments (confidential transactions in Monero). Besides the essential hiding and binding properties, the homomorphic one is applied so that if there are, for example, 3 commitments &#8211; a single commit for 1 coin, another commit for 4 coins, and another for 6 coins, their combination would result in a single commitment for 11 coins.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"244\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-1024x244.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3123\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-1024x244.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-300x71.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-768x183.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-1038x247.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Homomorphic property of a Pedersen commitment</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s now apply this to Monero’s confidential transactions in a practical example.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"261\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-1024x261.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3124\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-1024x261.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-300x76.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-768x196.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-1038x265.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Confidential transaction example</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, for the last essential part of Monero &#8211; <strong><em>ring signatures</em></strong>. To introduce this concept, we can start off with an example of a typical Bitcoin transaction. In it, every input has a deterministic mapping to a single output. This makes the system quite simple and easy to use at the cost of enabling transaction tracking. In contrast to this approach, ring signatures provide a cryptographic mechanism that allows many outputs to be mapped to a single input. Monero basically manages to create a transaction signature via ring signatures that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Proves that one of the secret keys was used to make a transaction</li><li>Doesn’t reveal the public key that was used in the transaction</li><li>Prevents the usage of the same public key in future transactions</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To best illustrate how this works, imagine that you are given a bucket of lego pieces that can be combined to form a circle. You also have your very own lego piece which is identical to all of the others in the bucket, but only you know that it’s your own piece. Now, you take random pieces from the bucket and, together with your piece, build a circle without anyone looking. You then take the circle, give it to someone and ask them to pick out exactly your piece. Intuitively, the success of the person depends on pure chance &#8211; the fewer pieces in the circle, the greater the chance of the person guessing which piece is exactly yours. Not only that, but if you always use the same piece, the person guessing might start noticing it, so that’s why it’s important to also use a different personal piece each time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This non-technical analogy, while basic, highlights the most essential aspects of ring signatures in Monero. For a short summary of the math behind the mechanism, you could check out the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-1024x903.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3125\" width=\"1024\" height=\"903\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-1024x903.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-300x265.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-768x678.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-653x576.png 653w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Basic example of a ring signature transaction</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ongoing research focusing on privacy in cryptocurrencies is very active. As presented in the first part of this blog post, there are several viable solutions that focus on making privacy-enhancing technology compatible with current cryptocurrencies. But, many active projects have taken this a step further and succeeded in creating new cryptocurrencies which are all about keeping coin users anonymous.<br>With the risk of repeating myself, regardless of whether you think anonymity in cryptocurrencies is important or not, privacy is something that shouldn’t be neglected! It’s such a hot topic in today’s tech world for a reason. As long as cryptocurrencies continue to strive towards being a viable and even better alternative to fiat currencies, they have to at least try and be better in every aspect possible. Of course, the physical aspect of cash seems rather impossible to replicate via a blockchain. Privacy, however, is something that could and must be improved and hopefully, developers will continue to improve this aspect of the technology that is the future &#8211; cryptocurrencies!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Privacy-enhancing cryptocurrencies While the previous blog post concerned itself with privacy-enhancing Bitcoin-compatible protocols, in this one we will analyze a [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"158","title":"Lets Talk Blockchain","path":"/category/lets-talk-blockchain/"}],"author":{"name":"Aleksandar Hadzhiyski","path":"/author/aleksandar/"}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-04-22T11:00:00","id":"3022","title":"Cryptocurrencies and privacy [part 1]","path":"/blog/cryptocurrencies-and-privacy/","content":"\n<h2>Privacy-enhancing Bitcoin-compatible protocols</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, privacy has become such an important topic within the many technologies we use in our lives that it’s only natural for us to ask the question: <strong>Where does privacy stand in the world of cryptocurrencies?</strong> The intuitive answer of many people unfamiliar with blockchain technology is that cryptocurrencies provide full anonymity and privacy. Similarly to a famous pawnshop owner bargaining on their tv show: \n<em>“Anonymity? Sorry, best I can do is pseudonymity.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a starting point, let’s define what anonymity means in the context of cryptocurrencies. The term could be explained as the sum of pseudonymity and unlinkability.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity.png\" alt=\"privacy through anonimity in cryptocurrencies\" class=\"wp-image-3024\" width=\"748\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity.png 1495w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity-300x115.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity-1024x393.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity-768x295.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity-1038x399.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><figcaption>Anonymity in cryptocurrencies</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Those two concepts are very closely intertwined and it’s important to point out that the latter isn’t simply a nice-to-have rather an essential part. I’ve heard many times the incorrect assumption that even if one’s pseudonyms (blockchain addresses) are linked, how could that possibly lead to the person behind those pseudonyms. In reality, many cryptoasset services hold some kind of personal identifiable information (PII). All it takes is one pseudonym to be linked to the PII and the thread unravels. Let’s take a closer look at the most famous cryptocurrency &#8211; Bitcoin and why it’s not fully anonymous.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Firstly, cryptoassets built on a blockchain are public and that includes both transactions and addresses.</li><li>Secondly, addresses could be linked via clustering heuristics used in different tools such as Chainalysis, CipherTrace, and GraphSense.</li><li>Lastly, as previously mentioned, many cryptoasset services hold PII that lead back to the people behind addresses.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these points lead to the fact that transactions along with senders and recipients of payments could be linked to specific users. It’s easy to see that Bitcoin is missing the unlinkability part from the anonymity equation. Not only that but also the offered privacy is arguably worse than that of traditional banking. In the end, the underlying blockchain put together with the data saved from different exchanges creates somewhat of a privacy hell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that at this point we can agree that although the early promises and expectations from cryptoassets were for anonymity, linkable payments are the de facto status quo. Looking back at more than a decade of cryptoassets, we can observe an ever-increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as means of payment. However, with great power comes great responsibility. On the one side, there’s the positive increase in acceptance, while on the other side there are all of the negative news throughout the years: the shutdown of the Silk Road Darknet Marketplace, the famous Mt. Gox hack, the Bitstamp security breach, the DAO hack, the wave of Ponzi schemes and ICO scams. If you ask me, those events are inevitable for a new and emerging technology in the field of payments. Just like every new creation there still are a lot of unknowns and problems that should closely be analyzed and solved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that spirit, let’s look at the opportunities to avoid linkability in cryptocurrencies. The first approach I will analyze is the application of Bitcoin-compatible solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Coin mixing</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3025\" width=\"748\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing.png 1495w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing-300x115.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing-1024x393.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing-768x295.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing-1038x399.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><figcaption>Tagged coins go in, untagged coins go out.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic idea of coin mixing is quite straightforward. An arbitrary amount of honest users each put the same amount of “tagged” coins as input in the mixer and wish to obtain that amount of “untagged” coin if the mixing was a success or receive back the original “tagged” coins if the mixing failed due to some reason. Of course, the described process sounds intuitively like a centralized service of sorts. There are several issues with that: the mixing service can always link coins to users and it’ll almost surely require some kind of fee. We can also mention theft by the service as a potential issue although there are protocols that can make the mixing service accountable for the number of coins (BNMCKF Mixcoin proposal). An example for a centralized trusted mixing service is bestmixer and for an untrusted mixing server &#8211; <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf\" class=\"rank-math-link\">TumbleBit</a>. Great, now that the shortcomings are pointed out, the logical question is: What about decentralized solutions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized mixing sounds great due to several reasons. There is no central service, theft is impossible, it provides inherently better anonymity and lastly, it follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s decentralized philosophy for Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>CoinJoin</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The first decentralized mixing protocol to mention is the <a href=\"https://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/fileadmin/papers/2017/2017-maurer-trustcom-coinjoin.pdf\" class=\"rank-math-link\">CoinJoin</a> protocol. I’ll try to make a very short and non-technical summary of the protocol and if you feel it’s unjust, please excuse me. The first step is to find users who also want to mix the same amount of coins as you. After that, you exchange input and output addresses for the transactions. Every user constructs their transaction (where does the user want to send coins to), sends it around, collects signatures from the other users, and before signing (confirming the transaction) also checks that their output is present. After that, the transaction with the inputs and outputs is broadcast to the Bitcoin network. So far, this protocol fulfills the decentralization and no-theft requirements. However, it introduces another big problem. That is, if a malicious user “infiltrates” the CoinJoin group, then that user knows the input/output combinations of all the other users and has no problem sharing that information with someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>CoinShuffle</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where an improved protocol called <a href=\"https://petsymposium.org/2014/papers/Ruffing.pdf\" class=\"rank-math-link\">CoinShuffle</a> comes into play. CoinShuffle’s main improvements are that it provides unlinkability (input/output combinations aren’t linkable to users) and robustness (if there’s a malicious user, they will be exposed). CoinShuffle functions similarly to a pinboard where users willing to participate indicate that by generating cryptographic key pairs and posting the public key. It’s important to note that CoinShuffle can guarantee unlinkability and robustness as long as there are at least 2 honest users on the board. The protocol itself has two main building blocks &#8211; <em>layered encryption</em> and <em>permutation</em> that ensure it can work as intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3026\" width=\"748\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption.png 1495w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption-300x115.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption-1024x393.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption-768x295.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption-1038x399.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><figcaption>Layered encryption</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3027\" width=\"748\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation.png 1495w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation-300x115.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation-1024x393.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation-768x295.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation-1038x399.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><figcaption>Permutation</figcaption></figure></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So, once the protocol is initiated, each user generates an output address and has to use the key pair with which the user “joined” the board. After that, each participant uses their signature key to sign their input address + public key and post that to the board. Then, each user applies onion encryption to their output address using the public keys of the “upcoming&#8221; users and adds that to the chain of encrypted output addresses. The idea is that the different encrypted output addresses are indistinguishable by the other users since they could decrypt only one layer and so, in the end, no user can link any output address to a specific user.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3028\" width=\"914\" height=\"243\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle.png 1828w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-300x80.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-1024x272.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-768x204.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-1536x408.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-1038x275.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px\" /><figcaption>CoinShuffle shuffling phase</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the robustness, there’s no guarantee that a malicious user wouldn&#8217;t just refuse to sign the transaction when it’s their turn and thus force the mixing to fail. There is, however, a solution for that situation as well and it’s called the blaming phase. Since the cryptographic key pair used to “post” on the pinboard is created only for the current transaction, it’s no problem to reveal all private (decryption) keys in the case of a failed transaction. Following the reveal, all encryption steps are replicated and the “malicious” user whose private key is missing can be exposed and kicked from the protocol. After that, the protocol should force the remaining participants to create new Bitcoin addresses and cryptographic key pairs for improved privacy before running again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After covering those two protocols in a somewhat informal manner, we can conclude that there’s a real possibility to enhance the privacy of Bitcoin transactions while remaining fully compatible with the currency. It is safe to say that what applies to Bitcoin, can generally be used for a great number of other cryptocurrencies as well. You might be impressed by the improvement in privacy a protocol can bring and naturally ask yourself: &#8220;Well, if the protocol’s so great, why isn’t it the norm?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s simple &#8211; users can decide for themselves to ignore it and simply use the cryptocurrency as originally designed. No one can enforce the usage of privacy-enhancing protocols on a global scale. Some wallets implement them, nevertheless, a lot of users decide to perform their transactions in a “vanilla” fashion with the idea that they don’t have anything to hide so they have no problem with their transactions being linkable. Whether that’s a correct approach or not, everyone can decide for themselves. The main point is to not lose sight of the importance of privacy in today’s world and that includes the ever-growing field of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of whether you agree with the previous statement or not, there are already solutions that try to combat the inherent privacy issues found in Bitcoin and other cryptoassets. They achieve this by taking a step further than the privacy-enhancing protocols and building new cryptocurrencies with privacy at their cores. Those privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies try to correct flaws in other cryptoassets at the cost of being inherently more complex and not having backwards compatibility. Prominent examples are Monero, Zerocoin, and Zerocash. They implement interesting improvements over older cryptocurrencies and will hopefully, continue to grow. In the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/cryptocurrencies-and-privacy-part-2/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">second part of the blog post</a>, we will dive deeper into their details to further clarify the possibilities of keeping your data private in the world of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Privacy-enhancing Bitcoin-compatible protocols Nowadays, privacy has become such an important topic within the many technologies we use in our lives [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"158","title":"Lets Talk Blockchain","path":"/category/lets-talk-blockchain/"}],"author":{"name":"Aleksandar Hadzhiyski","path":"/author/aleksandar/"}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-02-26T15:00:18","id":"2780","title":"Talking about Blockchain, NFTs, ART, Join us on Clubhouse App","path":"/blog/blockchain-nfts-art-talk-on-clubhouse-app/","content":"\n<p>Hey there people!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve invited some of the most interesting blockchain enthusiasts to host a meet in Clubhouse App on Monday, Mar 1, 10 AM PST.

If you have missed it you can check it <strong><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/lets-talk-blockchain/lets-talk-blockchain-vladislav-dramaliev-part-1/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Part 2 we are going to discuss the need for crypto in the world; the need for regulations; decentralization, Eth2.0, and more just keep reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Why do you think the world needs crypto? Or why not?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The world definitely needs crypto! One of the reasons is the fact that it provides an alternative to the current financial and banking system. It&#8217;s very early to determine if this alternative is successful, but so far, is doing quite well. I think crypto is changing the way people think about money, and what money is, what value is, how value is created or destroyed, and who or what controls it. I think crypto and blockchain enable to create new financial products more suitable for a high-tech society. I am certain that with open blockchain infrastructure&nbsp; banking and financial services will be automated and will become more transparent and more trustworthy. I think in the 21st century, it&#8217;s important to look at the technology on how it can solve issues and not just stick to systems that have remained unchanged for hundreds of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With blockchain technology, smart contracts, automation, and artificial intelligence, the world of finance, banking, and insurance could change dramatically in the next years for the benefit of the users. These services can reach parts of the globe, which currently don&#8217;t have access to banking and financial services. Of course, a lot needs to be done on scalability and UI?UX before that. But that’s coming. For the developed world, I believe public, permissionless blockchain technology is the only viable deterretto the dystopian futures that could be created by states or corporations. Blockchain technology and crypto is leverage against these constantly increasing powers. Of course, crypto enthusiasts&nbsp; don&#8217;t have an army yet, so we need to rely on soft power. But soft power is becoming increasingly important in the 21st century. So when I think about blockchain and crypto &#8211;&nbsp; they&#8217;re not trying to destroy the existing financial and banking services, but want to push them towards greater transparency, and make them evolve in a way. So I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a war between the two but more of a synergy that we are going to witness in the future. Still, if things don’t go the way we want them in the traditional finance and banking space, we can always fall-back to public blockchain platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Do you think that crypto projects need stricter regulations? In the crypto space, we always talk about decentralization, but still, someone has to be responsible?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very complex and important issue. I think the transparency aspect is more important here because crypto is more easily trackable and identifiable. There are, of course, practices that enable people to completely or at least, to a large extent, conceal their identities. I think the crypto space is kind of self-regulating. But since the crypto market cap is growing to trillionsof dollars (that&#8217;s not a small amount, but in comparison to the rest of the financial and banking space it&#8217;s not large) regulators will become more interested in it. So regulations are coming. For the larger part of humanity, regulations will actually open the doors to crypto, the minority of cyberpunks, maximalists, idealists and people who are looking into crypto in a more philosophical way, will also get what they want in terms of decentralization and the whole spirit of the technology, but I think there will be a compromise made on both sides &#8211; between those who don&#8217;t want regulation and the ones that want full regulation. I believe we will meet somewhere in the middle. This will be a positive development, depending on what exactly these regulations look like. Some of the proposed regulations that I&#8217;ve seen sound impossible to implement in practice. It&#8217;s very interesting to see how far that will go. In the EU the regulation around  crypto and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/defi-decentralized-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">DeFi</a> will be formed by legislation but also some interesting European Court of Justice rulings. So regulation is inevitable, like it or not. It might change the user experience, but at the same time, it might bring a lot more users to the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Do you believe in true &#8220;decentralization&#8221; and to what extent do you think it can be achieved?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think everyone&#8217;s focusing on decentralization, and this is not the point here. I think trustlessness is more of a key point. The ability to be sure that certain applications cannot be stopped or affected by anyone that is out there, and are functioning as they are supposed to be, without anyone being able to stop them or modify them. Decentralization is actually not a natural state in our physical world when it comes to how systems work. A direct example here is the competitive advantages in economics, and production at scale &#8211;&nbsp; it&#8217;s much more efficient to create a factory that creates a specific product. So in terms of efficiency, it&#8217;s much more adequate to be centralized and many systems are pushing in this direction. So what we are actually trying to do here is fighting against natural laws in order to achieve robustness. But I don&#8217;t think that pure decentralization can be achieved. We can see that even in Bitcoin, which is one of the most decentralized blockchain networks. There are four pools that produce more than&nbsp; 75% of the entire network. They are composed of individual miners, yes, but there is still centralization. The economic incentives keeping the network running are more important than decentralization. I like the decentralization aspect because of the existence of copies of the blockchain, that&#8217;s what makes it valuable. But apart from that, I don&#8217;t think decentralization is what keeps it running. I think the strong economic (game-theoretical) incentives that Bitcoin established are what’s protecting the network. I am, however, a fan of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Proof of Work</a> and still believe it is the better <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Sybil attack mechanism</a> in comparison to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Proof of Stake</a>. PoW connects the blockchain with the real-world via the conversion of energy into crypto, while PoS relies only on questionable economic incentives. I don’t like losing that real-world connection, but that’s where most of the altcoin projects are heading. Let’s see how that will go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What do you think about Eth2.0 and what do you think makes it better than other platforms on the market?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>That is also a controversial topic. Everyone was looking forward to <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">ETH2.0</a>. It looks like it might be one of the best well-protected solutions because of the whole amount of Ether that is currently being staked in order to be mined. But, let&#8217;s see how it goes. It&#8217;s going to be the first major implementation &#8211; the proof of stake. I think it will be a process before we really make it robust and move away from the proof of work chain. What makes it good is just the fact that <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Ethereum</a> in general is a brand that is one of the best-known names in the technology world and is just second to Bitcoin. It has a huge amount of dev resources behind and it has institutional support and the Ethereum ecosystem is unlike any other solution out there. From a technological point of view, I really can&#8217;t say I haven&#8217;t looked into the details. And even if I have, I&#8217;m just a marketing guy, and I heavily rely on the opinions of other people. But keeping in mind how many years it has been working, and how many devs are actually working on it. I believe that it might be a success. I&#8217;m still not convinced that proof of stake is really the best technology out there and I also don&#8217;t think that Ethereum is currently the best technology out there. But it&#8217;s still the most popular so it enjoys the largest network effect. That is a guess again. The best technology does not always win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>It has recently been talked about the long-awaited Tapoot and Schnorr signatures in the Bitcoin space, do you think this is a step forward in favor of privacy and scalability for Bitcoin? What do you think about Bitcoin upgrades?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think those upgrades are very important and I am waiting for them impatiently, to be honest. They will make the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/running-full-bitcoin-node-over-tor-on-ubuntu/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Bitcoin network</a> more efficient without increasing the block size, and also make it more private. And this privacy is actually the part that I&#8217;m most interested in because I think Bitcoin requires more privacy. On the other hand, we have witnessed that some privacy coins were delisted by exchanges. So it&#8217;s interesting to see how that will work. What I think will happen is that some people will use the privacy-preserving features of the Bitcoin network, but exchanges and other big economic actors won&#8217;t. So in effect, the Bitcoin network will functionally be divided into a formal public and private-public network. . This will be the best way forward because if all transactions are private, large economic agents participating in the Bitcoin ecosystem will have a harder time serving users. But definitely, there should be some straightforward solution for privacy without resorting to mixer services. So all upgrades to the Bitcoin network are welcome. And of course, they need to be implemented very carefully, because we don&#8217;t want to lose any trust in the network. It&#8217;s very important to keep the Bitcoin network robust and well-secured.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What advice would you give to people who are just entering the Blockchain space, whether as users or developers?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, as users, I always give the advice to do some research and get some crypto. Even small amounts will push you further down the rabbit hole. You&#8217;ll start looking at charts more frequently, then you&#8217;ll be reading the news more frequently,&nbsp; at your position 24 times a day. Are you in profit? Are you at a loss? What are the reasons behind that and so on. That’s how you get hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for developers? Well, what can I say, it would be an interesting time for them. Because you know, <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/defi-decentralized-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">decentralized systems</a> are very different from centralized ones. The processes of developing, upgrading, and securing them are different. But definitely, I think this technology will be fundamental in the future. And I think blockchain will be in some form behind most of the banking and financial transactions after 5 to 10 years, unless something more efficient, or something more secure, manages to attract a large developer resource and liquidity. But again, as I said, it&#8217;s not always the best technology that wins, but the technology that most people are using. So join us in the blockchain space. It&#8217;s one of the most exciting spaces in 2021. It&#8217;s super-fast-paced. The scale and speed of innovation is just mind-boggling. And yeah, it&#8217;s never ever dull, so join the fun and get future-proofed.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In Part 1 of our interview with Vlad, we talked about Blockchain and DeFi projects, the current bull-run, and more.

A passionate Blockchain enthusiast, Founder and Director of <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-bithope-foundation\">The BitHope Foundation</a> (the first Bitcoin crowdfunding platform in Europe), Co-Founder and Community Lead at <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Sofia-Crypto-Meetup/\">Sofia Crypto Meetup</a>, and Marketing Manager at <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://mettalex.com/\">Mettalex</a>. In this first part of our interview, we talked about the recent bull-run, the DeFi space, some interesting blockchain projects, and more. See what his opinion on these topics was:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How would you explain Blockchain to someone who never heard of the technology?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The way I explain Blockchain is &#8211; a distributed database copied 1000s of times, and whenever someone wants to make an edit or a change in that database, all of the other databases are notified and need to be updated as well. These changes to the database are governed by a set of rules also called consensus protocol. These rules are enforced by cryptography (laws of physics). <br><br>Currently, blockchain&#8217;s most viable and widely spread use is in the financial sector. Blockchain is used to store information about who owns what and any updates to this database are translated into transactions of changes of ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first blockchain database is actually <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/running-full-bitcoin-node-over-tor-on-ubuntu/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Bitcoin</a> and we have seen that Bitcoin has been functioning very well without any major issues for more than 12 years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What interesting projects have you encountered? What problems do they solve and in which areas are they most often linked to?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned Blockchain technology is most developed in the financial sector. You can store any type of information, but large files are expensive to store on a public blockchain. You cannot store videos, photos or even small files, but you can store their hashes and follow or monitor if any changes to have been made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can store unfalsifiable information about anything that has happened in the past via hash-based timestamps. This has numerous applications, for example, supply chain management where you can be certain about the lifecycle of a product thanks to the consecutive time-stamping by different supply chain participants along the product’s journey from raw material to the final product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another useful case is record-keeping by storing hashes of documents. When a specific version of a document has been first introduced, and you can check if it has been changed afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the blockchain system as the ultimate source of truth about a number of different questions like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Who owns what?</li><li>Who owned what?</li><li>When an action was done and by whom?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is a new type of technology that enables truth-keeping. And that’s at the core of our civilization!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What are the differences between the previous Bull-Run in 2017 and the recent jump in cryptocurrency prices?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the previous bull-run was provoked primarily by ICOs, causing a very high demand for Ether and Bitcoin, in particular, and that&#8217;s why the price of these two currencies really increased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of other coins increased as well because there was a lot of hype around Bitcoin and Ethereum. Everyone was looking for the “next bitcoin” and ICO teams were promising users fantastical applications. The narrative was that basically any problem can be solved with a blockchain. Which is definitely not true. Furthermore, the infrastructure was nowhere near ready for 95% of all the decentralized apps that were promised. Back then the bull-run was primarily caused by retail investors, regular guys with small amounts of money, who were looking to make a quick buck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the ICO extravaganza was a prerequisite for decentralized finance (DeFi) to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference now is that technology has matured significantly. There are many use cases that can be realistically realized (and are being realized). There is also DeFi on Ethereum</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as a brand name, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are much more known and much more trusted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real change that happened in 2020 was the outbreak of the Corona Virus pandemic, which caused economic devastation around the globe. That led to uncertainty and excessive printing of money. Central banks are just increasing the monetary supply to levels that we have never seen before. This pushes investors to move away from fiat, due to inflation expectations. That’s one of the main reasons that push investors into cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin because they. Bitcoin has existed for more than a decade and hasn’t had any major hacks or glitches, it&#8217;s the first cryptocurrency, it’s the first blockchain, it&#8217;s robust and it&#8217;s the most secured one. In 2020, it proved that rules that were set in the protocol back in 2009, when the system launched, continue to be perfectly executed 11 years after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, it&#8217;s very limited. There will ever be just 21 million bitcoins and 20% of them are lost or locked forever. So, there is a very limited supply of this digital asset that could be sent all around the globe for a few satoshis, irrespective of what amount is being sent. People or companies can transfer millions or even billions in bitcoin for a couple of cents/dollars in transaction fees and can store them quite effortlessly without the risk of falsification. A bitcoin cannot be faked. Unlike, for example, Gold, which is a pain to transport, secure and has been faked for thousands of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>In your opinion, does the recent jump in the price of bitcoin fundamentally affect the technology itself and people&#8217;s interest, or is it just hype?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I think there are a lot of fundamental reasons why the price is rising. As I mentioned, Bitcoin is a unique asset, a new asset class, that retail, investors with big pockets, corporations, and financial institutions are considering for portfolio diversification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve also witnessed its price history in the last 12 years and the fact that it has performed phenomenally. And it&#8217;s this limited supply feature that is essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is definitely not only hype. The world is going high-tech. Fiat currency is collapsing. Whole economies are in tatters. Users are fleeing to scarce assets. Bitcoin’s enormous advantage is that it has solved digital scarcity, making it extremely suitable for the digital age and highly useful to high-tech new generations.&nbsp; There is an element of hype, of course, because people are looking at the price going up, and they&#8217;re FOMOed about it but there are a lot of fundamentals under that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What is your opinion about the DeFi space and are there any projects that you find interesting and encouraging?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a large audience of investors both retail and institutional are discovering the DeFi space. I&#8217;m super bullish about it as well. I believe that it is the logical continuation of the Bitcoin idea. It is definitely not “De” yet, but we are getting there. It is impossible to solve decentralization for such complex applications too quickly. Currently, the Defi ecosystem is well-developed primarily on Ethereum, but I think due to the high gas fees, DeFi ecosystems are being developed on other platforms and more advanced infrastructure as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think ecosystems on other chains will develop and they will also converge. The next big and interesting thing, which will come to DeFi, is to follow how regulations will affect the space. Currently logging in with just a Web 3 wallet, it&#8217;s great, the onboarding is quick but this will have to change at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to see how DeFiusers will react to any KYC and AML. There are a number of solutions there that I like in this respect like <a href=\"https://www.yoti.com/\">YOTI</a>. I think this need for KYC/AML in DeFi will push the development of self-sovereign identity solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some projects I&#8217;m interested in &#8211; Aave, Uniswap, UMA, Compound (I&#8217;ve entered in DeFi through it). I was using Compound to generate an interest rate on a deposit in USDC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very interested in L2 solutions such as Optimism, Matic, Polkadot, ZK-Rollups. I would like to see how this will work in the real world, and also keen to see if Uniswap V3 will integrate with Optimism. I believe this could be a game-changer because currently the gas fees are just crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course I&#8217;m interested in <a href=\"https://mettalex.com/\">Mettalex</a> &#8211; the project I&#8217;m currently involved in. It aims to build a decentralized commodity derivatives exchange. We believe that all assets are moving on-chain and would like toWe bring new commodity markets to the DeFi space. This will enable speculators to short or longSteel, Zinc, Lithium Carbonate, Natural Gas, Iron Ore, spreads like BTC/Gold, BTC/Oil, and even sDEFI/sCEX. We are constantly researching what new markets users may be interested in. But actually, users will be able to create markets themselves. Mettalex also enables liquidity providers (LPs) to supply stablecoins to Mettalex’s Autonomous Market Makers and be rewarded in trading fees and governance tokens. This is actually one of the unique features of Mettalex &#8211; 87.5% of all MTLX tokens will be distributed to liquidity providers in a period of 8+ years. No ICO/IEO, no whales, no large team and advisers distribution. The tokenomics logic is similar to that of Bitcoin where miners who provide utility to the network get rewarded with new bitcoins. In the case of Mettalex &#8211; the utility is liquidity, and the rewards are in MTLX tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another unique part about Mettalex is that it is trying to solve real-world issues for physical commodity holders. Those are medium and small-sized enterprises that are dealing with the actual commodities themselves in the physical world &#8211; we are providing them with a low-cost hedging solution so they can manage risks in a cost and capital-efficient way. The project is Cambridge, UK-based and the Founder and CEO &#8211; Humayun Sheikh, is very experienced in the tech sector and in trading commodities. He actually was a founding investor in DeepMind which was later bought by Google for $500m. Mettalex is a spin-off of <a href=\"https://fetch.ai/\">Fetch.ai </a>which is focusing on developing advanced blockchain infrastructure, decentralized AI-based oracles, and a global internet-of-things economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What are the steps to be followed for a successful project in the blockchain space?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very interesting question and at the same time it’s a very hard one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people that are best suited to successfully implement/create projects in the DeFi space are often developers who have an economic or financial background. Because the core of decentralized finance is a kind of crossover between finance, technology, and blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So apart from having the skills, you&#8217;ll have to have a great design and marketing team to get the word out. Currently, it&#8217;s very noisy in the DeFi space, because many different companies are out there, trying to promote their products, fighting for liquidity. It&#8217;s a super competitive field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very core though, you need to get the tokenomics, which actually refers to the game-theoretical incentives, right. This goes back to economics and getting the token economics right (most DeFi defy projects are featuring tokens). So it&#8217;s essential to get the tokenomics right. You have to also be careful how you go to market, how you promote your product, how you distribute the tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also have to listen to the community very closely and make sure their reasonable requests are met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What could help is to have a background in finance and/or trading, in the real financial world, or experience in a company that&#8217;s finance or banking-focused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surely, the team and the experience of its members are of paramount importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you need to make as much as possible to audit the code well and avoid any loss of trust. That’s the most valuable resource in the crypto/DeFi space (and actually in the real-world). Once you lose it, it is hard to get it back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>If an investor is looking for a Blockchain development company to partner with to run his project, what are the criteria for making the choice? What to look for?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s pretty straightforward. The development company should have a good track record of working with other projects and be proficient with Solidity, and all the application-level languages like Javascript, Python, GO, and Java. Having built various SDKs and Middleware-types of software is a big plus since it means that the company is aware of fundamental blockchain principles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe it&#8217;s important to get acquainted with what projects have these companies developed and worked on before. Some of them are consultants as well. So they need to be able to consult the client on what is the best solution, what fits them, and if this specific solution requires a blockchain at all. Most clients are not very versed in the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s also important how quickly certain products can be delivered. And of course, the cost is very important for many. Standard stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the company is a one-stop-shop with marketing services, community services, content services, and everything this could be also useful, but might be a bit controversial, because it&#8217;s good for the company to be focused on one thing or a few things only. The larger it becomes the more slowly it moves and the less innovative it becomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read so far then you liked what Vlad has to say about the blockchain and DeFi space.
