A passionate Blockchain enthusiast, Founder and Director of <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-bithope-foundation\" class=\"rank-math-link\">The BitHope Foundation</a> (the first Bitcoin crowdfunding platform in Europe), Co-Founder and Community Lead at <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Sofia-Crypto-Meetup/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Sofia Crypto Meetup</a>, and Marketing Manager at <a href=\"https://mettalex.com/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Mettalex</a>. In this first part of our interview, we talked about the recent bull-run, the DeFi space, some interesting blockchain projects, and more. See what his opinion on these topics was:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How would you explain Blockchain to someone who never heard of the technology?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The way I explain Blockchain is &#8211; a distributed database copied 1000s of times, and whenever someone wants to make an edit or a change in that database, all of the other databases are notified and need to be updated as well. These changes to the database are governed by a set of rules also called consensus protocol. These rules are enforced by cryptography (laws of physics). <br><br>Currently, blockchain&#8217;s most viable and widely spread use is in the financial application. Blockchain is used to store information about who owns what and any updates to this database are translated into transactions of changes of who owns what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first blockchain database is actually <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/running-full-bitcoin-node-over-tor-on-ubuntu/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Bitcoin</a> and we have seen that Bitcoin has been functioning very well without any major issues for more than 11 years. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What interesting projects have you encountered? What problems do they solve and in which areas are they most often linked to?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned Blockchain technology is most developed in the financial sector. Usually, you can store any type of information. Of course, the public blockchain is very expensive to store information on the chain. So, you cannot store videos or files, but you can store the hashes of these digital documents and follow or monitor if any changes to these documents have been made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you can also do is basically use a blockchain database, for storing information about anything that has happened in the past via timestamps. This has applications, for example, supply chain management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another useful case is record-keeping by storing hashes of documents. So, that, you know, when a specific version of a document has been first introduced, and you can check if it has been changed afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the blockchain system as a source for truth regarding a number of different questions like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Who owns what?</li><li>When an action was done and by whom?</li><li>When did a specific thing happen in the past?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is a new type of technology that enables truth-keeping. Very interesting!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What are the differences between the previous Bull-Run in 2017 and the recent jump in cryptocurrency prices?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the previous bull-run was provoked primarily by ICOs, causing a very high demand for Ether and Bitcoin, in particular, and that&#8217;s why the price of these two currencies really increased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of the other coins increased as well because there was a lot of hype around the Bitcoin and Ethereum, and everyone was very into the different projects that were announced back in 2017. But back then the bull-run was primarily caused by retail investors, regular guys with small amounts of money, and smaller investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference now is that technology has matured significantly since then. There are much more use cases, there is also DeFi on Ethereum, in 2020 the Bitcoin halving happened which also brought more interest in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as a brand name, cryptocurrencies are much more known and much more trusted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real change that happened in 2020 was the outbreak of the corona pandemic, which has caused economic collapse all around the globe. Which  has led to uncertainty and non-stop printing of money. Central banks are just increasing the monetary supply to levels that we have never seen before. I think just investors are trying to fly away from Fiat, which is expected to inflate. That’s the reason investors are actually jumping into cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin because they believe it&#8217;s trusted. It has been functioning for a while, it&#8217;s the first cryptocurrency, it&#8217;s a very robust system and it&#8217;s very well secured. I mean, it proved that rules that were set in the protocol back in 2009, when the system launched, are continued to be perfectly executed 11 years after that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore it&#8217;s also very limited because there are just 21 million bitcoins and 20% of them are lost or locked forever. So, there is a very limited supply of this digital asset that could be sent all around the globe for just dollars, irrespective of what amount you want to send. People can send millions or billions even in Bitcoin for couple of cents/dollars in transaction fees and you can store it very easily without the risk of this being falsified. So your Bitcoin cannot be faked. Unlikely, for example, gold, which is super hard to transport, secured and there are many different forgeries with gold.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>In your opinion, does the recent jump in the price of Bitcoin fundamentally affect the technology itself and people&#8217;s interest, or is it just hype?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I think there are a lot of fundamental reasons why the price is rising. As I mentioned, Bitcoin is just a unique asset class that investors with big pockets and actual financial companies are trying to use in order to diversify their portfolios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve also witnessed its history in the last 11 years and the fact that for the last one or two years Bitcoin has performed phenomenally in terms of gains doesn&#8217;t go unnoticed. And it&#8217;s this limited supply feature that is super important. So it&#8217;s not only hype there is an element of hype, of course, because people are looking at the price going up, and they&#8217;re kind of hyped about but there are a lot of fundamental systems that go under all of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What is your opinion about the DeFi space and are there any projects that you find interesting and encouraging?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a large audience of investors both retail and institutional are discovering the DeFi space. I&#8217;m super interested in that space as well. I believe that it will develop a lot in the future. Currently, it is primarily on Ethereum, but I think due to the high gas fees, DeFi ecosystems are being developed on other platforms and different infrastructure as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think ecosystems on other chains will develop and they will also converge. The next big and interesting thing, which will come to DeFi, is to follow how regulations will affect the space because currently, you know, logging in with just a wallet, it&#8217;s great, the onboarding is very quick but I believe that this will have to change at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to see how the users will react to any KYC and AML. So it&#8217;s very hard to predict how this will be implemented, but let&#8217;s wait and see what will happen in the near future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some projects I&#8217;m interested in &#8211; Uniswap, Compound (I&#8217;ve entered in DeFi trough it). I was using compound to generate interest rate on a deposit in USDC.<br><br>I&#8217;m very interested in L2 solutions such as Optimism network. I would like to see how this will work in the real world, and also keen to see how Uniswap V3 will integrate with optimism. I believe this could be a game-changer because currently the gas fees are just crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course I&#8217;m interested in Mettalex &#8211; which is the project I&#8217;m currently involved in. It involves a decentralized commodity derivatives exchange. So in short &#8211; we would like to bring new commodity markets to the DeFi space and enable speculators to trade on these new markets. We will also enable liquidity providers (LPs) to actually provide liquidity and be rewarded in governance tokens. Which adds a yield like element to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The very interesting part about this project is that we are also trying to solve issues for physical commodity holders. Such as medium and small-sized enterprises in the field, like companies who are dealing with the actual commodities themselves in the real world &#8211; we are providing them with a low-cost hedging solution which Mettalex is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore I&#8217;m very interested in Sythetix &#8211; I&#8217;m still looking forward to their implementation out of optimism on L2 which I&#8217;ve tested and I can say it works great &#8211; transactions are super, super cheap. But still in terms of UX &#8211; you have to wait for a very long period of time (a couple of weeks) before you can withdraw funds. Maybe I&#8217;m not using it the correct way, let&#8217;s see how it gets implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What are the steps to be followed for a successful project in the blockchain space?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is very interesting question and at the same time and it&#8217;s very hard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people that are best suited to successfully implement/create projects in the DeFi space are often developers who have an economic background or financial background. Because the core of decentralized finance is some kind of crossover between finance, technology, and blockchain technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So apart from having the skills, you&#8217;ll have to have a great design and marketing team to get the word out. Currently, it&#8217;s very noisy in the DeFi business, because many different companies are out there, trying to promote their products, fighting for liquidity. It&#8217;s a very competitive field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What could help is to have a background in finance, in the real financial world, or to be involved in a company that&#8217;s finance or banking focused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s not forget one very important thing &#8211; token economics. So again, this goes back to economics, but getting the token economics right for your project (most DeFi defy projects are featuring tokens). So it&#8217;s super important to get the economics right and how you go to market, how you promote your product, how you distribute the tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s very, very complex, but I think the most important is the skills and the team&#8217;s experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>If an investor is looking for a Blockchain development company to partner with to run his project, what are the criteria for making the choice? What to look for?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s pretty straightforward. The development company should have a track record of your work and they should be obviously very proficient with Solidity and all the different languages that are required to make the project successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experience working with different SDKs, languages and techniques primarily used in the blockchain space are some of the criteria to look for in software companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe it&#8217;s important to get acquainted with what projects have these companies developed and worked on before. Some of these dev companies are consultants as well. So they need to be able to consult the client on what is the best solution, what fits them, and does this specific solution makes sense in the case of their business. Because most of the clients are not very versed in the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s also important how quickly certain products can be delivered. And of course, the cost is very important for many. This is standard stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the company is a one-stop-shop with marketing services, community services, content services, and everything this could be also useful, but might be a bit controversial, because it&#8217;s good for the company to be focused on one thing only. The larger it becomes, I guess, the more slowly it moves. So yeah, it&#8217;s a trade-off of what kind of services do you provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read so far then you liked what Vlad has to say about the blockchain and DeFi space.
