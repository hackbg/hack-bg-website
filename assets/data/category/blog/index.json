Gaming, Supply Chain Music, and Art were some of the industries that were covered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;NFTs have a lot of uncovered potentials.</p><p>It was very interesting to follow different art, designer and digital creators, starting to embrace NFTs as a new way to monetize their work as blockchain is becoming more accessible to a wider audience.‚Äù</p><cite>Milen</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed the element of subjectivity in art and&nbsp; Who decides what is the value of an art piece that is an&nbsp; NFTs of some sort?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Well, basically, market, just like in the regular space, if someone is willing to pay.</p><p> A banana taped to a wall for $120 000, if someone is willing to pay for that, then that is the price. The price covering the NFTs art is working with the same mechanism as the regular art only a bit fancier&#8221;.</p><cite>Luka</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the key moments were when discussing existential and pragmatic questions like how digital art is going to be presented to the world, how you will ‚Äúhang it‚Äù&nbsp; and how the trend should be set.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about virtual space where you hang it in the middle of your wallet, it&#8217;s because the first thing somebody does is check out your wallets. And to see what are you holding crypto, and also NFTs. So, it&#8217;s like, inviting people to your house to see your artwork, but in your wallet.‚Äù </p><cite>Luka</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Or just imagine some virtual museum tours around digital art emerging out of this non-fungible tokens hype. So I think this from one side, it&#8217;s too difficult to grasp from the traditional art that we&#8217;re used to seeing. But from other perspectives, it brings up a lot of new models that may emerge as businesses and as ways to communicate or to cherish or see art in general.‚Äù </p><cite>Milen</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest lies within your imagination üôÇ</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We debated about what is behind the hype and why there is hype behind it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;And my opinion is that it represents a unique way of earning money for people who were basically, we have gatekeepers all around them, musicians, artists gaming, but anything that is expressive, which was unable to be directly monetized, and now it&#8217;s monetizable.‚Äù</p><cite>Luka</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We concluded that every generation has something of its own. Now real artists have many new exchanges and platforms that are emerging that are allowing them to create or trade or invest in portfolios. Now, after several years of development, the user interfaces and the whole user journey and flow are smoother than it was once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But still,  there is a lot more to go. And we think that&#8217;s also a topic to be brought up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this the optimal way to use NFTs? Or should it be more simple for people or users or regular non-tech people? For example, someone that is not technically advanced? Why shouldn&#8217;t they use NFT&#8217;s in digital arts or digital collectibles of some sort? And what is the next big thing for NFTs?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those and more questions were on the agenda for our first hackCast. But we want to hear your opinion on the topic as well.&nbsp;Comment below or contact if you have some interesting idea you want to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We thank our first guests Milen and Luka for the interesting conversation and the friendly and congenial atmosphere they created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are looking forward to the next hackCast!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Hey guys, yesterday (Mar 1) our first hackCast took place on the Clubhouse app.&nbsp; For the first topic we selected [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"9","title":"Blog","path":"/category/blog/"},{"id":"5","title":"Events","path":"/category/events/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-02-18T14:47:21","id":"2719","title":"5 Industries Blockchain Will Change Forever","path":"/blog/5-industries-blockchain-will-change-forever/","content":"\n<p>While blockchain was once seen solely as the force behind cryptocurrency, now is one of the fastest-growing technologies in the digital world that has come into the limelight in the last few years. Today, blockchain is a widely spread idea that is poised to change the very face of many industries, businesses, and the exchange of data. Considering the benefits and security blockchain offers, tech-heads are trying to employ different ideas to remove the central authority and disrupt various industries, of course for their own benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What is Blockchain?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we look at which industries Blockchain has the biggest impact and is likely to drastically change, let&#8217;s take a glance at what Blockchain is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A blockchain consists of a list of records known as blocks, which are linked to one another using cryptography forming a chain. Since each block comes with a cryptographic hash of the previous block, transaction data, and a timestamp, no data can be modified. This helps in recording transactions between two parties efficiently with better security and transactional transparency.&nbsp;The virtues of Blockchain technology lead to potential benefits including greater transparency, enhanced security, improved traceability, increased efficiency and speed of transactions, reduced costs, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain technology</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering these benefits and the security blockchain offers, it is most likely going to revolutionize many business sectors. But since there is no sure-shot of which industries will be disrupted and where organizations will fail,&nbsp;here are 5 industries that most likely to undergo a renaissance of their own:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Finance and Banking</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2400\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/@bermixstudio?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\">Bermix Studio</a> on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/coin?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Blockchain is particularly known from cryptocurrencies, it should be no surprise that the most common industry using blockchain, is banking and finance.&nbsp;According to a recent IBM survey, 91% of banks are investing in blockchain solutions, and 66% of institutions are expecting to be running at scale with blockchain. It seems that blockchain is finally poised to shake up financial markets in a way that will benefit both consumers and financial institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every day, millions of transactions take place in the banking sector and blockchain can help in maintaining a secure system that keeps permanent records of these transactions. This not only lowers the risk with better security but enables faster and cheaper transfer thanks to the decentralization offered by blockchain. From making cross-border payments faster to removing the costly middleman it‚Äôs already impacting the international as well as domestic banking network. Implementing distributed ledger technology in the banking sector is a great step towards making banks more profitable and valuable as this ledger is distributed, published, and stored in multiple locations and when a transaction occurs, it is added to each copy of the ledger. Because there are many copies of the ledger, blockchain is practically immutable to hackers and frauds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that many advantages, come many use cases. Here are some of them:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cross-border transactions &#8211; Using digital currency based on blockchain technology, one can easily transfer tokens from one place to another, that too without the use of a third-party organization. Moreover, blockchain-powered payment processes can reduce transaction time to mere minutes, and that too with enhanced security, transparency, and affordability. The transaction costs are also reduced and take only a few hours to process and complete international transfers;</li><li>Trade finance platforms &#8211; create smart contracts between participants, increasing efficiency and transparency, and opening up new revenue opportunities;</li><li>Digital identity verification &#8211; When customer identifying information is secured using blockchain, banks can increase public trust while protecting against fraud and speeding up the verification process significantly;</li><li>Credit reporting &#8211; Blockchain-based credit reporting is more secure than traditional server-based reporting and may also enable companies to take non-traditional factors into account when calculating credit scores.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Undoubtedly, Blockchain technology has a lot to offer for the Financial and Banking industry. At a global level, blockchain is being considered by many as a solution to the multiple challenges banks are facing in settlement and clearing, collateral management, KYC, trade finance, or digital identities. With growing enthusiasm for future growth among the banking CEOs (77% of CEOs of banks worldwide), implementing disruptive technologies like blockchain is on the initiative&#8217;s agendas. That sounds promising, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about how <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain benefits the Financial sector</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Healthcare</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2721\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/@nci?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">National Cancer Institute on Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let‚Äôs face it. The healthcare industry has been in need of a significant disruption when it comes to securing patient‚Äôs health records, lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical supply chain, lack of interoperability between databases holding patient health records, and dispersity of healthcare-related information, be it patients‚Äô medical history or medical staff credentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the inherent security and decentralization, the benefits of blockchain in healthcare are numerous. That‚Äôs why blockchain technology is so important to the industry. It can revamp the trust by securely storing medical records that can be accurately and safely transferred to and accessed by the doctors and people who are authorized while eliminating the need for a central authority and enabling rapid access to data. It can improve the safety of patients‚Äô electronic medical records, facilitates health data monetization, and enforces interoperability between healthcare organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another healthcare concern revolves around counterfeit medication and blockchain technology can control this, too. The problem is that, often, counterfeit medications are difficult to distinguish from real ones. Blockchain technology solves this problem by using supply chain management protocols where the medicine provenance can be traced, reducing revenue losses and guaranteeing patients safety. A BIR Research stated in a report titled ‚Äú<a href=\"https://bisresearch.com/industry-report/global-blockchain-in-healthcare-market-2025.html\">Global Blockchain in Healthcare Market- Analysis and Forecast, 2017-2025</a>.‚Äù that ‚ÄúThe most prominent beneficiaries of the technology will be the pharmaceutical companies, which lose approximately $200 billion to counterfeit drugs each year. By enabling complete visibility and transparency throughout the drug supply chain, blockchain will allow tracking of drugs to their point of origin and thus, help to eliminate falsified medication, reducing revenue loss by up to $43 billion annually for pharma companies,‚Äù</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of healthcare organizations implementing Blockchain technology into their systems is rapidly growing. According to a<a href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/blockchain-market-in-healthcare\" class=\"rank-math-link\"> report</a>, the value of the blockchain market in the healthcare industry was $2.12 Billion in 2019 and estimated to reach $3.49 Billion by 2025. So there is nothing else to conclude except that the healthcare industry is among those that are about to be revolutionized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Checkout more on <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-healthcare/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain and Healthcare</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Supply Chain</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2723\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-432x576.jpg 432w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@tierramallorca?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Tierra Mallorca</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/supply-chain?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand how blockchain can transform the supply chain, let‚Äôs look at the challenges in the supply chain. Currently, the supply chain management system is plagued by a lack of efficiency and transparency and most networks face difficulties when trying to integrate all parties involved (suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, auditors, and consumers) and the current model makes it difficult to maintain a consistent and efficient supply chain system &#8211; which impacts negatively not only the profitability of the companies but also the final retail price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Blockchain technology is all about decentralization, transparency, and immutability, there is high interest in how Blockchains might transform the supply chain and logistics industry and solve its problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subsequently, Blockchain can increase the efficiency and transparency of supply chains and positively impact everything from warehousing to delivery to payment. Most importantly, Blockchain provides consensus‚Äîthere is no dispute in the chain regarding transactions because all entities on the chain have the same version of the ledger. All this leads to less time delays, less human errors, less costs, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is estimated that the global blockchain supply chain market size was valued at $ 93.16 million in 2017, and is projected to reach $ 9,852.91 million by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 80.2% from 2018 to 2025. Big industry giants like Unilever, Nestle, Tyson, and Dole are now implementing blockchain projects and solutions for tracking and guaranteeing the authenticity of their products. Walmart is another company that uses blockchain to keep track of its pork it sources from China and the blockchain records where each piece of meat came from, processed, stored, and its sell-by-date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more on how <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain can improve Supply Chain Management</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Real Estate</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-1024x769.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2724\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-768x577.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-1536x1153.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-2048x1538.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-767x576.jpg 767w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@tierramallorca?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Tierra Mallorca</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/real-estate?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional real estate has always been a sphere of business for the ‚Äúwell-resourced‚Äù individuals and organizations. Moreover, a real estate business is extremely prone to high levels of corruption and dishonesty. According to the United Nations, from 800 billion to 2 trillion USD dollars is laundered globally every single year, of which the biggest part comes from real estate operations. According to the estimates of the United Nations, this figure is in the region of $1.6 trillion per year. And that is not all, obstacles such as lack of transparency, lack of liquidity, realtor and banking fees, transaction speed, frauds, etc. are driving people away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology can have a significant impact on solving these challenges, as it has the ability to benefit enterprises as well as individuals in many ways. One of the biggest impacts of Blockchain on commercial real estate would be a smoother, faster contract management process, automation of real estate transactions, acceleration, as well as becoming more accessible. Lets see some more use cases:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Blockchain makes the transaction process more efficient and cuts costs &#8211; Blockchain technology can make transactions of real estate more efficient and less costly by reducing the number of intermediaries. Transactions facilitated on a blockchain can be made within minutes and cost only a fraction of its current price. Expensive intermediaries, such as real estate agents, appraisers, and notaries are cut out of the process.</li><li>Blockchain makes the real estate industry more transparent &#8211; Blockchain technologies‚Äô immutable and decentralized nature can have a significantly positive impact on transparency within the real estate market and can assist in combating money laundering and tax evasion. Through blockchain technology, documents, and events during the purchase of a property can be tracked, contracts become readable, and registries cannot be changed afterward. Furthermore, it also establishes an all-encompassing overview of where investments come from and who the actual owner of a property is. As a result, it becomes more difficult for criminal organizations to launder illegally obtained money through the purchase of properties.</li><li>Blockchain makes real estate investments more accessible &#8211; Blockchain technology enables new ways to invest in real estate which benefits companies as well as individuals. Blockchain technology allows individuals and companies to purchase and trade only fractions of real estate, and in turn, enables fast and easy transactions of ownership. This creates liquidity and ultimately makes the real estate industry more accessible.</li><li>Tokenization &#8211; Tokenization refers to the securitization of digital assets. After an asset has been tokenized, it can be divided into more granular pieces, hence it becomes available to a larger audience. In the case of real estate, tokenization reduces costs of investments, allows fast and easy transactions, and provides liquidity in an otherwise slow-moving industry. Consequently, it enables more people to invest in real estate, also investors with only minimal available capital.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All these use cases lead to benefits like &#8211; Faster and more efficient processing of transactions, No manipulation of ownership, Low transaction costs, Low barrier to investing in real estate, Professional opportunities for the regular investment community, and many more</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering all those benefits blockchain offers for the real estate industry, it should be a matter of time to be implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-real-estate/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain &amp; Real Estate</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Insurance</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2725\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-863x576.jpg 863w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@homajob?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Scott Graham</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/insurance?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The operational inefficiencies of the insurance industry are many: Loads of paperwork worsening the customer experience; complicated claims management presenting an operational nightmare for insurers; risks of fraud, lack of trust, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By switching to blockchain solutions, many opportunities lie ahead for the insurance industry.
