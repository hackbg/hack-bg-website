That means everything from the artist, the painting to the origin and region can be forged. And since Blockchain is all about transparency and building trust, people came up with a solution to deal with this issue. In order to prove authenticity, artists now can attach gadgets (like the one your dog might have to avoid being lost) to their artwork and later being scanned for all the information a collector needs to prove provenance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Blockchain development is still in progress and is yet not time-tested so problem can occur in a matter of safety. The problem here might be in the IoT devices that have a public key that is generated by the manufacturer, which is creating conditions for duplications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"Fractional-ownership\"><strong>Fractional ownership</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By breaking to small fragments the monolithic painting and tokenizing it, sellers are able to fragment the ownership of the artwork using blockchain. Surprisingly, people get excited to participate in a new model of ownership and let’s say own a fraction of Andy Warhol’s “14 Small Electric Chairs”. This innovation improves valuation of artwork because of the interest it can attract.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using fractional ownership, people who have never been associated as collectors, can get involved in the art market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"Digital-ownership\"><strong>Digital ownership&nbsp;</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to what is said above, we actually get to talk about Cryptokitties. What they’re really showing us is the fact that people do not want to buy traditional art and what they are buying is a new form of digital collectible. People are actually ok with buying things that can not be touched and exist only in a&nbsp; digital environment, but are interesting and innovative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you need to know that is you don’t actually own the image, but the code and it gives you the right only to trade or sell it.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><p id=\"Invest-in-artist\"><strong>Invest in artist</strong><br></p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creators can tokenize themselves, putting them on the market place. It’s like stock market for artist and you can invest in their career.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing in an artist sets a kind of relationship which could be defined by a smart contract, describing what percеntage the investor owns, for what period of time and how dividends are distributed. Binding it with smart contracts about the artist’s artwork sale, investors obtain a&nbsp; percentage of the profit or investors buy tokens and later getting a discount of the artwork’s price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participаnts’s job is to set the terms that suit them the most, as long as cryptocurrency is paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology is making us change the concept of how we interact with the surrounding world. It changes artwork outview, making it easier, more transparent and in interesting way, developing new manners of creating and trading art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain wants to be the parsley of every dish and one of the many fields of expression is the art industry.

We have just two words for you – Blockchain technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blockchain technology has the potential to solve some very basic business problems and can change the way you run your business by saving you time, guarantee your safety and transparency, reducing costs and the risk of fraud.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>A <em><a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contract</a> </em>is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions by completely eliminating third parties (middleman) or any rent-seeking the third party. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Here are some problems Blockchain can solve to improve your business:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Banking</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of queuing for hours in the bank just to send money for a fine, tax, fee or purchase you can do the transferring through blockchain applications. Regardless of the amounts, the process is easier, reduces the transaction cost significantly and is a secure alternative to traditional bank transfers.  This is especially true if you are transferring funds overseas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Let’s  say you have to purchase goods for the sum of 100 000,00 USD. Making a transaction via a bank will cost 1,5% of the amount (1 500 USD), 4 business days and 30 minutes in the bank. Now if you make a transaction of the same amount through a blockchain-based application, the commission of 0,0001% saves you 1 499.90 USD.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Paying Employees</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is\nbest known for cryptocurrency, so it is completely natural to be used as a\nmethod of payment. Instead of transferring wages through banks, it can be used\nas a Bitcoin-based payroll service to reduce the time it takes for such funds\nto move from bank to bank. Payments made via Bitcoin can save both money and\ntime for both employers and employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Supply Chain</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwing to the blockchain and special devices, entrepreneurs and clients\ncan know track &nbsp;the goods, know in which\ncondition they are stored and when will they arrive. That makes it easier to\nconfirm the origin of the product, which builds trust between seller and buyer\nand declines the risk of fraud.\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, every product is traceable and it can be maintained a record of the supply chain management so if a product is lost midway it can be found again. If you want to know more about the supply chain, you can read our article <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\">“Blockchain in Supply chain”</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Smart contracts</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> Using smart contract allows you to sell, exchange shares, money, documents without the use of intermediary services such as brokers, notaries, agents, etc to make a transaction which saves you time and costs. Smart contracts can also help solve the mistrust issue between business partners by writing in the code <em>If – Then </em>statements (conditions) so that the algorithm first checks if everything is fulfilled to define action.  <br><br>Furthermore, every smart contract you make is transparent which gives you extra trustworthiness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit of using&nbsp;smart contracts and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/blockchain-software-development/\">blockchain technology</a> for businesses&nbsp;come in the form of speed, cost, safety, and precision. Smart contracts are one of the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/decentralized-applications-development/\">applications of blockchain</a> that can vastly help companies in securing deals and helping run more full-fledged businesses.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Whether you are a young entrepreneur or someone who has run a business for years, you certainly have come across obligations or procedures that take a lot of your time and effort.
