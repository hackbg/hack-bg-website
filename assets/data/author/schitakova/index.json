They are one of the basic pieces of infrastructure that make it possible to send and receive funds through blockchain networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we are going to cover the evolution of cryptocurrency storage and evaluate the different types of wallets so that by the end of reading this article, you would be sufficiently well-versed and educated regarding the history of wallets and be properly equipped to decide which crypto wallet option is best for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, if you are new to Blockchain and how it operates, here&#8217;s a brief <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">overview of the technology powering cryptocurrency wallets</a>, to better understand exactly how they work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How Wallets Work?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, crypto wallets don&#8217;t truly store “coins”. What owners of cryptocurrency do own is a piece of code called <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utxo.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs)</a>. Since the cryptocurrencies never leave the blockchain space, the wallet’s work is to generate the necessary information to send and receive cryptocurrency via blockchain transactions. Among such information consists of one or more pairs of <a href=\"https://www.preveil.com/blog/public-and-private-key/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">public and private keys</a>. For the cryptocurrency investor, the cryptographic public keys and private keys are the most important elements of a cryptocurrency wallet. Public keys are similar to account usernames; they identify the wallet so that the user can receive tokens without revealing their identity. Private keys (or seed phrase) are similar to pin numbers; they allow the user to access the wallet and check balances, initiate transactions, and more. The wallet also includes an address, which is an alphanumeric identifier that is generated based on the public and private keys. Such an address is, in essence, a specific &#8220;location&#8221; on the blockchain to which coins can be sent to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically the process of a transaction is as follows: to make a transaction one will need to sign (confirm) the transaction with a private key as a digital signature. The wallet will then check with the blockchain the amount of UTXOs there are available. The blockchain will confirm the amount of UTXOs the wallet has, before sending the transaction to the nodes in the network to verify that the transaction makes sense. Transactions are then placed in a &#8216;mempool&#8217;, a waiting area for unconfirmed transactions to be chosen by miners to verify, complete, and append the transaction to the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Timeline of Bitcoin Wallets:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2009</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Satoshi Nakamoto began working on the first bitcoin wallet concurrently with his development of the Bitcoin protocol, as he knew that these coins had to be stored somewhere, and as such in February 2009, was the release of Bitcoin-Qt wallet &#8211; the first-ever Bitcoin wallet. It was a full client wallet, which meant you had to download the entire blockchain history for it to sync, which back then wasn’t an issue, since there was precious little history to record. While functionality was limited, the Qt wallet did have a few advanced features to it. In addition to sending and receiving coins and incorporating an address book, it enabled the user to digitally sign arbitrary messages, proving that they were the owner of a particular public key.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2014</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014 as the price of Bitcoin began to reach $1,000, people soon realized they needed a safer way to store their newfound wealth. A company named <a href=\"https://trezor.io/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">TREZOR</a> (Czech for &#8220;vault&#8221;)&nbsp; was the first to release a cold storage consumer hardware wallet as we know it today, the TREZOR One.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside, in 2014 the first <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Ledger Nano</a> was released and quickly managed to stand out thanks to its attractive price and security features – specifically, its use of a second-factor authentication (2FA) card.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2015 &#8211; 2016</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The popular next step included larger and more defined screens for devices to further improve security while also giving something back to the whole user experience. <a href=\"https://shapeshift.com/keepkey\" class=\"rank-math-link\">KeepKey</a> is a company that hit the market in 2015 and focused on those elements and did well for itself by virtue of its large, clear display screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2016 was the year when next-gen Ledger Nano S arrived on the market. It added the now-standard screen in lieu of the 2FA card, cementing its position as one of the most popular options around and sliding into the market as the cheapest hardware wallet with a screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2017 &#8211; now</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ledger Nano S is still standing here from 2017 and is accompanying crypto-mania that is rolling around. As one of the most highly-regarded options at the time, the Ledger was in a position to catch as much of the new market as it could carry, and the Ledger Nano S was flying off the shelves. Suddenly everyone is doing bitcoin, and there isn&#8217;t a hardware wallet manufacturer on the planet able to keep up with the unprecedented surge in demand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Types Of  Wallets</strong>:</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2439\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@neonbrand?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">NeONBRAND</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-wallet?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the way they operate,&nbsp; cryptocurrency wallets may be defined as &#8220;hot&#8221; or &#8220;cold&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Hot wallets:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A hot wallet is any wallet that is connected somehow to the Internet. The main purpose of holding cryptocurrency in a hot wallet is to facilitate basic transactions. Individuals looking to actually make purchases with their cryptocurrency assets might consider choosing a hot wallet. They are the ideal option for storing small amounts of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and are a fast way of spending and receiving payments. These wallets are quite easy to set up, and the funds are quickly accessible, making them convenient for traders and other frequent users.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Think of a hot wallet like your wallet today: you use it to store some cash, but not your life savings. Hot wallets are great if you make frequent payments, but not a good choice for the secure storage of bitcoins. &#8211; Jordan Tuwiner Founder, Buy Bitcoin Worldwide</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Cold wallets:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Cold wallets have no connection to the Internet. Instead, they use physical gadgets to store the keys offline, making them resistant to online hacking attempts. As such, cold wallets tend to be a much safer alternative to &#8220;storing&#8221; coins. This method is also known as cold storage and is particularly suitable for long-term investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets come in many forms in a matter of how they can be stored. Generally, wallets are divided into three main groups &#8211; Software wallets, Hardware wallets, and Paper wallets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Software wallets:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Software wallets come in many different types, each with its own unique features. Most of them are somehow connected to the Internet and are considered hot wallets. The following are descriptions of some of the most common types of software wallets: web, desktop, and mobile wallets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Web wallets:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2441\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@austindistel?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Austin Distel</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-wallet?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Web wallets are used to access blockchains through a browser interface and are also known as hot wallets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These web wallets store your private keys on a web-server (very insecure), which is constantly online and controlled by a third-party operator. Different services offer different features, some of which can link to mobile and desktop wallets and replicate your addresses across the devices you own. But bear in mind that these wallets are connected to the internet, so it is not advisable to be holding large amounts of money in them, as online wallets are more vulnerable to hacks and security attack vectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other variations of the web wallets &#8211; browser extension wallets which are running locally on your machine in your browser as an add-on or extension.  They are considered to be <em><strong>safer</strong></em> than the abovementioned &#8211; of course when they are developed by well-known trusted developers and/or with an open-sourced codebase which you can verify at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some web extension wallets allow you to store cryptocurrencies native to a specific network &#8211; for example, the MetaMask wallet that can hold an <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\">Ethereum</a> based ERC-20 or ERC-721 token.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While others such as <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-tech-talks/waellet-browser-extension-wallet-for-aeternity-blockchain-network/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Waellet</a> &#8211; browser extension wallet enabling you to transact with <a href=\"http://aeternity.com\" class=\"rank-math-link\">aeternity</a> tokens or any <a href=\"https://github.com/aeternity/AEXs/blob/master/AEXS/aex-9.md\" class=\"rank-math-link\">AEX9</a> compatible fungible tokens on the aeternity network, are also enabling you with additional developer-focused functionalities such as token creation and deployment, an integrated naming system, and more (check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/waellet/waellet/wiki/Roadmap\" class=\"rank-math-link\">roadmap</a> as well).</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Desktop wallets:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Desktop wallets are installed on a desktop computer and provide the user with complete control over the wallet. When a new desktop wallet is generated, a file called <code>wallet.dat</code> will be stored locally on your computer. This file contains the private key information used to access your cryptocurrency addresses. In general, desktop wallets may be considered safer than the web and mobile wallets, as they don’t rely on third parties for their data and are harder to steal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are still connected to the internet, which makes them less secure. However, desktop wallets are a great solution for those who make frequent transactions of small amounts from their computers. It&#8217;s crucial to just make sure your computer is clean of viruses and malware before setting up a desktop cryptocurrency wallet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Mobile wallets:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2440\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@austindistel?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Austin Distel</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-wallet?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile wallets function much like desktop wallets but designed specifically as smartphone applications. They are quite convenient as they allow you to send and receive cryptocurrencies through the use of QR codes. As such, mobile wallets are particularly suitable for performing daily transactions and payments, making them a viable option for spending Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the real world. Just as computers, however, mobile devices are vulnerable to<a href=\"https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/common-scams-on-mobile-devices\"> </a>malware infection. So it&#8217;s recommended that you<a href=\"https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/encryption\"> </a>backup your private keys (or seed phrase) in case your smartphone gets lost or broken.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Hardware wallets:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"397\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger-1024x397.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2442\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger-1024x397.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger-300x116.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger-768x298.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger-1536x596.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger-1038x403.jpg 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger.jpg 1720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by https://www.ledger.com/</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, hardware wallets are physical, electronic devices that look like a USB flash drive, that uses a random number generator (RNG) to generate public and private keys,&nbsp; where the private key is stored in the device itself. These are cold wallets because they can only be accessed by being plugged directly into a computer and do not require an internet connection in order for a user to access their cryptocurrency funds.&nbsp;Some of the newer editions are enabled with Bluetooth so you can use them with your mobile phone as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hardware wallets are by far the most secure type of cryptocurrency wallet and are practically immune to virus attacks and there have been no verifiable incidents of money being stolen from a hardware wallet. If a cryptocurrency investor’s plan is to hold crypto for a long time or is holding large amounts of cryptocurrency &#8211; a hardware wallet is the ideal option for storing those. These devices, however, are the only wallets that are not free, and they can cost up to $200 and are often referred to as not user friendly and can be challenging for new users to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Paper wallets:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"680\" height=\"280\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/etherwaller-paper-wallet.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2444\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/etherwaller-paper-wallet.jpg 680w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/etherwaller-paper-wallet-300x124.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><figcaption>Photo by https://cryptomining-blog.com/</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Paper wallets also make use of public and private keys. Cryptocurrency users wishing to store their holdings in a paper wallet typically involves printing out an address and its private key onto a piece of paper. To set up a paper wallet, one should visit a wallet generator website or run one locally which will generate a keypair and present the keys in the form of QR codes. These codes can then be scanned using a mobile or another device to import in wallet software and later execute cryptocurrency transactions. It&#8217;s generally advised that users unplug their Internet access while the keys are being generated and that users wipe their Internet history after the keys have been created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to understand those paper wallets aren&#8217;t suitable for sending funds partially, but only their entire balance at once. If you want to spend part of the funds, you should first send all the tokens to another type of wallet (e.g., software wallet), and only then spend part of the funds. Although a paper wallet is considered an extremely secure way to keep bitcoins safe from cyber-attacks, malware, etc., they also come with risks, some of them severe. If the printer used for getting those on the paper used inexpensive ink, it may run or fade with time, wallet software no longer recognizes the private key format of the printed wallet, or the paper is lost, stolen, ripped, or otherwise damaged, making the wallet inaccessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Concussion:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each wallet type has its advantages and disadvantages, so it&#8217;s crucial to understand how they work and what you are going to use it for before making a choice with a wallet. For most users who are used to making on-the-go transactions, mobile wallets are the best option. However, hot storage systems are exposed to hackers and malware infection. If you are looking for long-term investment hardware and paper-based versions of wallets are the most secure alternatives for the job.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what wallet you choose to use, it’s important to remember to never share your private keys or the seed phrase, to keep both your wallet and mobile/desktop software up to date, to make regular backups, and enable multi-factor authentication features whenever possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have more questions regarding crypto wallets or anything concerning blockchain technology, don&#8217;t hesitate to contact Hack&#8217;s team! </p>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"tw-target-text\" class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"> </pre>\n","excerpt":"<p>Crypto wallets are an integral part of using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Over thousands of years, the options available have expanded from self-funding and peer-to-peer loans, to what we now call angel investors, bank loans, government grants, and internet-based crowdfunding. Raising capital is hard, even if your startup has high-profit margins and strong growth. In the best-case scenario, you secure financing after a month-long marathon of wooing investors, talking to banks, and collating reams of paperwork. But more likely, your months of hard work will leave you empty-handed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, a new option &#8211; blockchain-based funding &#8211; has arisen that may change the way we know fundraising. In this article we will look at traditional fundraising options and blockchain-based crowdfunding, comparing their potential and highlighting the benefits and drawbacks of each. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Traditional Fundraising:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Bank Loans</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of startups earn a bank’s stamp of approval because of a metric that matters a lot to bankers and not at all to the company: the founder’s personal credit score. Banks are still stuck in the days of inventory and asset-heavy businesses, back when real estate was still a safe investment. We have to say that these loans are a time-honored and reliable method of financing a small business, but banks often only finance firms with substantial collateral and a long track record, and the terms they offer are often very strict.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/etienne-martin-2_K82gx9Uk8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2421\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/etienne-martin-2_K82gx9Uk8-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/etienne-martin-2_K82gx9Uk8-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/etienne-martin-2_K82gx9Uk8-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/etienne-martin-2_K82gx9Uk8-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/etienne-martin-2_K82gx9Uk8-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/etienne-martin-2_K82gx9Uk8-unsplash-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@etiennemartin?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Etienne Martin</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/bank?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We still have to mention the advantages bank loans have like the predictable monthly payments and that banks do not take any ownership position or get involved in any aspect of running the business, but business owners should weigh the advantages and disadvantages of bank loans against other means of finance.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Venture Capitalists</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A venture capitalist (VC) is a private equity investor that provides capital to companies exhibiting high growth potential in exchange for an equity stake. This could be funding startup ventures or supporting small companies that wish to expand but do not have access to equities markets. Venture capitalists are willing to risk investing in such companies because they can earn a massive return on their investments if these companies are a success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big pro about venture capitalists is that the money is yours to keep<strong>. </strong>VC and angel investors are basically gambling on the business. If it succeeds, they win big; if it fails, they eat their losses. Unlike a bank loan, you have no obligation to repay VC funds. If you go under, you won’t have investor debt hanging over your head. But even though you don’t need to repay VC funds, the money comes with strings attached. Investors give you money in exchange for an equity share in your company. This dilutes the number of shares you hold and can offer future shareholders. Depending on the number of shares granted, you may be giving investors the right to make controlling decisions about your company.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Crowdfunding platforms</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Crowdfunding has become an increasingly popular way for individuals and businesses alike to raise much-needed capital ever since platforms like <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Kickstarter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Indiegogo</a> emerged on the scene about a decade ago. One of the biggest advantages of hosting a fundraiser on a funding portal is that you can concentrate all of your investor discussion into a single place and allows creators to test the initial market of early adopters before transitioning their product onto the actual market. Crowdfunding is a phenomenal way to test the market without building out a full website or a company. In other words, it enables you to test the waters to see whether your idea has merit without taking on a ton of financial risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scammers are by far the biggest con of the crowdfunding space as there are many projects that have a successful raise but do not pull through with the execution of the project. This reduces the trust between creators and early adopters. Startups must also be aware that crowdfunding doesn’t work for all businesses. It is targeted at more “consumer-facing” products like a watch or a game, but it most likely won&#8217;t raise capital if you want to start a catering company.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Decentralized Fundraising:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/precondo-ca-OlSGcrLSYkw-unsplash-1-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2422\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/precondo-ca-OlSGcrLSYkw-unsplash-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/precondo-ca-OlSGcrLSYkw-unsplash-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/precondo-ca-OlSGcrLSYkw-unsplash-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/precondo-ca-OlSGcrLSYkw-unsplash-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/precondo-ca-OlSGcrLSYkw-unsplash-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@precondo?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Precondo CA</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/fund?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>ICOs</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/ico-initial-coin-offering/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Initial Coin Offerings</a> (ICOs) is a popular fundraising method used primarily by startups wishing to offer products and services, usually related to the cryptocurrency and blockchain space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike VC where investors are allowed to purchase company stocks that have value in the form of percentages or shares, ICOs provide investors the opportunity to purchase coins of their own brand of digital currency as compensation. In other words, startups create a document essentially detailing exactly how their idea would work (usually called a white paper),  and explain why it&#8217;s a great project that could be very useful. Then, you ask for people to send you money (usually <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/082914/basics-buying-and-investing-bitcoin.asp\">Bitcoin</a> or <a href=\"https://thecollegeinvestor.com/19676/how-to-invest-ethereum/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Ether</a>) and in return, you send them back some of your own tokens with the hope that those tokens will get used a lot and be in high circulation, which would raise the value of the currency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary advantage of an ICO is that all the transactions are done online. Everything can be easily investigated and traced online. What makes ICOs more attractive than traditional fundraising is that they rely on blockchain technology to keep track of the transactions which doesn&#8217;t require unnecessary paperwork that more or less can take up time and energy. The big con is that many&nbsp; ICOs don&#8217;t undergo regulatory processes as the traditional fundraising methods, making them subject to malicious practices, which more or less can enable illegal companies to extract money from vulnerable investors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>IEOs</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/news/initial-exchange-offering-ieo-pros-and-cons/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">initial exchange offering</a> (IEO) is a crowdfunding strategy that is an alternative to the already known initial coin offerings (ICOs). In an IEO, the tokens are administered by a cryptocurrency exchange on behalf of the startup and not by the startup itself and it’s the crypto exchanges that raise funds. One of the key benefits of IEOs is the fact that they’re carried out with the help of a third party: the crypto exchange platform. The platform will screen every project that seeks to launch an IEO on its site. Exchanges want to maintain a good reputation and they choose token issuers carefully. That’s how they eliminate potential scam projects from raising funds. Any startup looking to issue tokens can take advantage of the processes on platforms and it will help them with marketing and streamlining the entire process. Another advantage of an IEO is that the token is immediately available for trading. After all, the token distribution and sale are done via an exchange, and practice shows that the token becomes available for trading within a week, while ICO’s can sometimes take up to months. And there are even a lot of cases where the token doesn’t even get to exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main disadvantage of IEOs comes at the price of listings and the cost associated with token sales can turn out to be quite high for startups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>STOs</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Security Token Offerings (STOs) are created and issued by a company looking to raise money. STOs, however, are similar to more traditional securities as they are backed by real assets – whether equity, debts/loans, or investment funds. STOs are a better choice for businesses looking to raise capital but don’t have a suitable platform for utility tokens. That’s because the value of security tokens is based on the value of the company or underlying asset, rather than on-demand driven by platform use. A major benefit of an STO is that it can be used to tokenize any asset relatively easily for trading online, which means that smaller, early-stage businesses can raise large amounts of capital quickly without needing to pay huge fees. Furthermore, security tokens allow you to divide underlying assets into smaller units, enabling fractional ownership, which makes it more affordable for some investors to contribute to your business. Another great advantage is that security tokens provide investors with more liquidity. Since there are thousands of investors locked into long-term investments in which they must wait until the maturity date to access their funds, it leaves these individuals without access to their money for years. Security tokens can eliminate these concerns. Once a fund is tokenized, an investor can buy and sell fund shares as they see fit. This produces a more effective flow of assets and enables the development of secondary trading platforms to handle new market opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest drawbacks to security tokens is the inability of non-accredited investors to own them. Another con is the secondary trading market restrictions. Security tokens can only be transferred via licensed platforms. The platforms must possess a security trading license in the country they operate in.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>DAOs</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>DAO is an organization that was designed as a form of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/venturecapital.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">venture capital fund</a> that is automated, decentralized, and based on open-source code without a typical management structure or board of directors. The idea behind this organization is to eliminate the human error or manipulation of investor funds by placing decision-making power into the hands of an automated system and a crowdsourced process. Basically DAO is the intermediary between startups and its investors but instead of a legal body, they have smart-contracts, instead of bank accounts they use cryptocurrencies, and instead of the jurisdiction, they have a borderless blockchain network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The very essence of DAO is that it was designed to allow investors to send money from anywhere in the world anonymously and it would then provide those owners tokens, allowing them voting rights in the decision making on possible projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides all that, Fundraising DAOs have many benefits for both investors and startups such as transparency in business relations, lowering the risks of manipulation, easy communications, decentralized decision making, and of course complete independence. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As seen in the article, blockchain fundraising has a number of benefits over traditional methods. Some include automation, speed, efficiency, fractionalization, liquidity, and flexibility leading to advantages as greater cost savings, opening up the potential for investors on a much wider and global level, and making the transfer processes faster, simpler, and more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst there is a space for many traditional fundraising options – whether crowdfunding for a small project or partnering with angel investors for both funding and advice, the benefits of blockchain-based crowdfunding are enormous and will likely take over from many traditional fundraising options in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of this article is to highlight and compare the potentials of both fundraising models and has no intention of giving financial advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for our next article piece about the Blockchain world &amp; Subscribe to our newsletter.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Fundraising has been occurring for as long as people have been using money to conduct business.

To achieve that DeFi relies heavily on cryptography, <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/blockchain-software-development/\">blockchain</a>, and <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/smart-contracts-vs-traditional-contracts/\">smart contracts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts are the main building blocks of DeFi. If you don&#8217;t know what smart contracts are, you can check one of the previous <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-are-smart-contracts-and-blockchain-adding-value-to-my-business/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">articles where this is discussed.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DeFi Projects. What is trendy?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is currently known that most if not all DeFi projects are built on <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Ethereum</a>. The main reason for this is that Ethereum’s programing language called Solidity allows writing advanced smart contacts that contain the most necessary logic for the DeFi applications. It is worth commemorating that Ethereum has the most advanced ecosystem across all the smart contract developers, in fact, all the applications mentioned here are built on Ethereum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article we are going to look at the different categories where DeFi is used:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Lending and borrowing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In this category, there is one main project that by this date is so far the biggest DeFi project &#8211; <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Compound</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has around 1.8 billion dollars worth of assets locked in the protocol. Compound is an algorithmic and autonomous protocol that allows users to supply assets such as Ether, DAI, Basic Attention Token(BAT), 0x, Tether, and start making interest. It also has the option to borrow other assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"401\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-1024x401.png\" alt=\"Compound finance market\" class=\"wp-image-2409\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-1024x401.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-300x117.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-768x301.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-1536x601.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-1038x406.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09.png 1742w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>https://compound.finance/markets date: 07.10.2020</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://makerdao.com/en/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">MakerDAO</a> is another project in the same category that allows users to use ETH to lend themselves money in the form of a stable coin called DAI and when users are ready to unlock their ETH, which serves as collateral for their DAI loan, they simply pay back the loan along with any fees. By combining loans with a stable currency, MakerDAO wants to allow anyone to borrow money and reliably predict how much they have to pay back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Stable coins</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of smart contracts and certain incentives a stable coin can be created pegged to the US dollar without having to store money in the real world. As we mentioned MakerDAO that locks in collateral and generates DAI. DAi is a good example of an algorithmic stable coin. Except for DAI, there are other non-algorithmic stable coins such as Tether and USD coin. The problem with them is the fact that they are centralized because there is a company that stands behind them which is responsible for holding the equivalent of the stable coins in US dollars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2398\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@bermixstudio?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Bermix Studio</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/coin?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>DEXs enables the exchange of crypto assets in a completely decentralized and permissionless way, without giving up the custody of the coins. In other words, your coins or tokens do not need to be held by a third party exchange while you trade. Decentralized exchanges can also prevent price manipulation and are more anonymous than exchanges that implement know-your-customer requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two main types of DEXs:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Liquidity Pool based is the first one. Examples for this type are &#8211; <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">UniSwap</a>, <a href=\"https://kyber.network/about/knc?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=8c58ddde734d1eb7030750ac46cf98eff58a2d6c-1602130160-0-Afgf-lIRnkrH7lOEGcF0_DHeWExaE1cuwbzCnV_J5fKVxIJNCvt3Mp8K-gDN85h8zWis_hPzNuEo0U9eVEuTgdgfaJm6qQ-cxCSH9R89CUd8jt12Y_dfImGXt_krupK3-7N7zl_odVU57vWY3mA_MtYf67QkqH-NP1gflm3CEbDV9dEBFsDQ7kdktUHoheJ1YaO1GG_w3qWtSvNLQ5XrxcFB9GZyKieQHAKASdPUu-N19y4o_k_p4um7VOK9GSSszdvkllXHiFuSOIIaaY8PZSoAStgpfjGzIZKbEOZquUXyPUteTC2eQ9KRCXjZDh0jInfHjRJpCcDkqeNBTH6rvMwSEaMyy18Sn-_n4jLF-KzJ\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Kyber network</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bancor.network/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Bankor</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Order Book based is the second type. <a href=\"https://loopring.org/#/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Loopring</a>, <a href=\"https://idex.market/eth/idex\" class=\"rank-math-link\">IDEX</a>, and <a href=\"http://weidex.market\" class=\"rank-math-link\">WeiDex</a> are examples of an order booked based decentralized exchange.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Margin Trading</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Margin trading similar to traditional finance is the practice of using borrowed funds to increase a position in certain assets. In contrast with regular trading in which traders use their own capital to fund trades, margin trading allows traders to multiply the amount of capital they are able to trade. This is why margin trading is also often referred to as leverage trading — “leverage” is the amount by which a trader is able to multiply their position. The main DeFi application in the margin trading space is <a href=\"https://fulcrum.trade/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Fulcrum</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Insurance</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance is another field of traditional finance that can be transformed into decentralized finance. Blockchain technology can contribute in many different ways enabling real-time data collection and analysis, which could make significantly speed up claims processing and payouts; ensuring that transactions are secure, authenticated, and verifiable, protecting customer&#8217;s privacy. It can provide certain kinds of guarantees of compensation in exchange for payment of premiums. One of the most popular applications are oriented with complications related to protection against smart contract failures and the protection of deposits. The most well-known insurance projects are <a href=\"https://nexusmutual.io/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Nexus Mutual </a>and <a href=\"https://opyn.co/#/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Opyn</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While more and more people are being drawn to these DeFi applications, it’s hard to say where they’ll go. Much of that depends on who finds them useful and why. Many believe various DeFi projects have the potential to become the next Robinhood, drawing in hordes of new users by making financial applications more inclusive and open to those who don’t traditionally have access to such platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for our next article piece about the Blockchain world &amp; Subscribe to our newsletter.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>What is DeFi?

They have the capability to receive, store, and send funds and even call other smart contracts by following if-then semantics. Some even may have heard of the expression “Code is law”- which means that technology is used to enforce rules. Basically the code dictates what we can and cannot do.<br>The smart contract’s aim is to remove the human factor from the decision making which is often proven to be the main cause of errors. A smart contract is usually written on the programming language called <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/\">Solidity</a>, which was created specifically for that purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Ethereum</a> is a good example of a blockchain that supports smart contracts. On the chart below we see the daily verification of contracts on Ethereum from the year 2016 to the year 2019 which shows us that there are a growing interest and usage of smart contracts. And there should be. Аlthough blockchain is a relatively young technology, it has certainly shown us through smart contracts many use cases why today’s world should shift towards decentralized interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"939\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chart-1024x939.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2366\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chart-1024x939.jpeg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chart-300x275.jpeg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chart-768x704.jpeg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chart-628x576.jpeg 628w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chart.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Source: etherscan.io</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In previous article, we looked at <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-are-smart-contracts-and-blockchain-adding-value-to-my-business/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">how Smart contacts are adding value to the business</a>. This time we shall see the benefits of the smart contracts by comparing them to the equivalent in real life &#8211; the traditional contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say you want to send tokens to someone, and that someone wants to send the same amount of other tokens. With a traditional contract, if you don&#8217;t trust the person, an escrow contract should be created, where a third party participates. The middle man would collect the token from both sides and then swap them. This approach already shows some problems that both parties of the contact may be facing:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"630\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RM7.8.19_ff_contractrisks.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2368\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RM7.8.19_ff_contractrisks.jpg 630w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RM7.8.19_ff_contractrisks-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><figcaption>Source: http://www.rmmagazine.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trusting Intermediaries:<br></strong>There is no guarantee that the third party will not run away with the tokens. Both sides should rely entirely on the reputation of the intermediary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>On the other hand, a smart contract will work in a fully automated and deterministic way, which means the same output will be generated from a given initial state/input, making sure that both parties receive their tokens when meeting the criteria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong><br>Depending on the intermediary, both parties may have to wait up to working time to settle the transaction of the tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With smart contacts, this kind of problem goes away. A contract can be fulfilled seconds after the initial criteria are met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost:<br></strong>A traditional contract is considered much more expensive than a smart contract, not just because of the third party that has to make a profit but also because there are so-called “hidden expenses” considering possible problems with the contract like arbitration for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"802\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/neonbrand-8fDhgAN5zG0-unsplash-1024x802.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2367\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/neonbrand-8fDhgAN5zG0-unsplash-1024x802.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/neonbrand-8fDhgAN5zG0-unsplash-300x235.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/neonbrand-8fDhgAN5zG0-unsplash-768x601.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/neonbrand-8fDhgAN5zG0-unsplash-1536x1202.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/neonbrand-8fDhgAN5zG0-unsplash-736x576.jpg 736w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@neonbrand?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">NeONBRAND</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/cost?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The blockchain protocol seems to eliminate the costs of external enforcement and, therefore, smart contracts are sold as self-executed and able to solve the problem of opportunism which characterizes traditional contracts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reusability:</strong><br>The same smart contract that is used to swap your tokens, can be used to swap anyone else tokens.<br>In the traditional world, separate contracts should be made and respective fees to the intermediary should be paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fraud:</strong><br>The intermediary should make sure that both the tokens that you and the other side have are legitimate before making a swap.<br>With smart contracts, the tokens can be verified on the blockchain, and with digital signatures, it can be certain straight away if the parties are eligible for spending their tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>The difference between the two types of contracts shows us that a new era of agreement is coming.

According to a recent article by Forbes <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/julieruvolo/2011/09/07/how-much-of-the-internet-is-actually-for-porn/#6848cf265d16\" class=\"rank-math-link\">outlining how much of the internet is porn</a>, for the year of 2010, out of the top 1 million web sites, <code>42 227</code> were &#8216;sex-related&#8217;. That occupies only 4% of the internet space. This number may at first look underwhelming, but this does not include the content itself in those sites and the overall traffic they accumulate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>More numbers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 2016 PornHub had 23 billion visits, which make around 64 million people a day viewing just one mainstream website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of content watched, and this is truly astounding, 5246 centuries worth of footage was viewed in just one year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data gathered by SimilarWeb showing the monthly traffic back in June 2019 allows us to see that 3.36 billion people have searched for and visited pornhub.com; 2.26 billion have visited Amazon.com and 1.81 billion &#8211; Netflix.com</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"986\" height=\"736\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-04-at-14.35.49.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2078\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-04-at-14.35.49.png 986w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-04-at-14.35.49-300x224.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-04-at-14.35.49-768x573.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-04-at-14.35.49-772x576.png 772w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px\" /><figcaption>Data traffic for month June 2019 </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That many searches for this term make the porn industry one of the most profitable in the world.

Among one of the most used cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether, TRON, Monero, and Zcash, but such platforms have the chance to develop their own blockchain-based utility token used only to be utilized in their platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users have the chance to send token tips to online porn actors and also in order to gain more popularity, porn sites can send its users tokens for encouraging them to watch and to tip through their streaming platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can also be achieved in a true peer to peer way without any intermediary cutting the cost for the middlemen (in the face of the platform used).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The problem</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/blockchain.jpg\" alt=\"Say blockchain one more time...\" class=\"wp-image-2334\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/blockchain.jpg 500w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/blockchain-300x211.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /><figcaption>Say blockchain one more time&#8230;</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, as every new technology blockchain has its flaws. One key feature is that information added to such a network cannot be changed without significant effort. In other words, personally identifiable information, full images and/or video clips can be added to the blockchain without the possibility to ever be removed. Which is making blockchain the perfect weapon for blackmailing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Аlthough <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">blockchain</a> is a relatively young technology, it has certainly won respect among world-leading industries such as the porn industry where cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on a decentralized public ledger, making it challenging to track a person’s pornography habits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The increasing interest in cryptocurrencies being used in the adult entertainment industry is a signal that cryptos are here to stay.

It has the capacity to unite different fields of the chain network and make a record of the whole path of every product and make it accessible at any given time.&nbsp; The idea is to make a single global source of information where “Veracious and Simplicity ”&nbsp; is the motto.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a class=\"rank-math-link rank-math-link\" href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/blockchain-software-development/\">blockchain technology</a> can highlight and detail at least five key product dimensions: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>nature (what it is)</li><li>quality (how it is)</li><li>quantity (how much of it)</li><li>location (where it is)</li><li>ownership (who owns it at any moment) </li><li>under what conditions the product was build or assembled. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In this way, blockchain allows customers to inspect the uninterrupted chain of custody and transactions from the raw materials to the end sale product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering that the fancy technology is most known for Smart Contracts and cryptocurrency, blockchain impacts not only the supply chain process and product management, but the financial transactions between different network parties as well.

You may all have heard of the CryptoKitties and Rare Pepe trading cards as the most popular form of blockchain art, but if we dig deep down into what really blockchain can do for the art industry, it’s not merely CryptoKitties.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"#authenticity-problem\">Authenticity</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#Fractional-ownership\">Fractional ownership</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#Digital-ownership\">Digital ownership </a>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#Invest-in-artist\">Invest in artist</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><p id=\"authenticity-problem\"><strong>Authenticity problem</strong></p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>An article published by The Daily Beast shows that 50 % of the art in circulation is fake. That means everything from the artist, the painting to the origin and region can be forged. And since Blockchain is all about transparency and building trust, people came up with a solution to deal with this issue. In order to prove authenticity, artists now can attach gadgets (like the one your dog might have to avoid being lost) to their artwork and later being scanned for all the information a collector needs to prove provenance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Blockchain development is still in progress and is yet not time-tested so problem can occur in a matter of safety. The problem here might be in the IoT devices that have a public key that is generated by the manufacturer, which is creating conditions for duplications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"Fractional-ownership\"><strong>Fractional ownership</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By breaking to small fragments the monolithic painting and tokenizing it, sellers are able to fragment the ownership of the artwork using blockchain. Surprisingly, people get excited to participate in a new model of ownership and let’s say own a fraction of Andy Warhol’s “14 Small Electric Chairs”. This innovation improves valuation of artwork because of the interest it can attract.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using fractional ownership, people who have never been associated as collectors, can get involved in the art market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"Digital-ownership\"><strong>Digital ownership&nbsp;</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to what is said above, we actually get to talk about Cryptokitties. What they’re really showing us is the fact that people do not want to buy traditional art and what they are buying is a new form of digital collectible. People are actually ok with buying things that can not be touched and exist only in a&nbsp; digital environment, but are interesting and innovative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you need to know that is you don’t actually own the image, but the code and it gives you the right only to trade or sell it.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><p id=\"Invest-in-artist\"><strong>Invest in artist</strong><br></p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creators can tokenize themselves, putting them on the market place. It’s like stock market for artist and you can invest in their career.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing in an artist sets a kind of relationship which could be defined by a smart contract, describing what percеntage the investor owns, for what period of time and how dividends are distributed. Binding it with smart contracts about the artist’s artwork sale, investors obtain a&nbsp; percentage of the profit or investors buy tokens and later getting a discount of the artwork’s price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participаnts’s job is to set the terms that suit them the most, as long as cryptocurrency is paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology is making us change the concept of how we interact with the surrounding world. It changes artwork outview, making it easier, more transparent and in interesting way, developing new manners of creating and trading art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain wants to be the parsley of every dish and one of the many fields of expression is the art [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"18","title":"Blockchain and Business","path":"/category/blockchain-and-business/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"}}},{"node":{"date":"2019-12-24T14:58:02","id":"1672","title":"How are smart contracts and blockchain adding value to my business?","path":"/blog/how-are-smart-contracts-and-blockchain-adding-value-to-my-business/","content":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/smart_contracts_business_value-1024x597.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1709\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/smart_contracts_business_value-1024x597.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/smart_contracts_business_value-300x175.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/smart_contracts_business_value-768x448.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/smart_contracts_business_value-987x576.png 987w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/smart_contracts_business_value.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Blockchain Smart Contracts</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are a young entrepreneur or someone who has run a business for years, you certainly have come across obligations or procedures that take a lot of your time and effort. We have just two words for you – Blockchain technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blockchain technology has the potential to solve some very basic business problems and can change the way you run your business by saving you time, guarantee your safety and transparency, reducing costs and the risk of fraud.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>A <em><a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contract</a> </em>is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions by completely eliminating third parties (middleman) or any rent-seeking the third party. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Here are some problems Blockchain can solve to improve your business:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Banking</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of queuing for hours in the bank just to send money for a fine, tax, fee or purchase you can do the transferring through blockchain applications. Regardless of the amounts, the process is easier, reduces the transaction cost significantly and is a secure alternative to traditional bank transfers.  This is especially true if you are transferring funds overseas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Let’s  say you have to purchase goods for the sum of 100 000,00 USD. Making a transaction via a bank will cost 1,5% of the amount (1 500 USD), 4 business days and 30 minutes in the bank. Now if you make a transaction of the same amount through a blockchain-based application, the commission of 0,0001% saves you 1 499.90 USD.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Paying Employees</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is\nbest known for cryptocurrency, so it is completely natural to be used as a\nmethod of payment. Instead of transferring wages through banks, it can be used\nas a Bitcoin-based payroll service to reduce the time it takes for such funds\nto move from bank to bank. Payments made via Bitcoin can save both money and\ntime for both employers and employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Supply Chain</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwing to the blockchain and special devices, entrepreneurs and clients\ncan know track &nbsp;the goods, know in which\ncondition they are stored and when will they arrive. That makes it easier to\nconfirm the origin of the product, which builds trust between seller and buyer\nand declines the risk of fraud.\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, every product is traceable and it can be maintained a record of the supply chain management so if a product is lost midway it can be found again.
