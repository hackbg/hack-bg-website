When it does, it will mean greater transaction privacy, efficiency and crucially, it will unlock the potential for smart contracts, a key feature of its blockchain technology that eliminates middlemen from even the most complex transactions. Taproot is the most significant upgrade to the bitcoin network since the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/optimizing-segwit-bitcoins-new-software-giving-scaling-boost\">block size increase</a> in 2017 and it has been widely anticipated as a major first step toward solving bitcoin&#8217;s lack of privacy and other related concerns. But what is Taproot, and how will it benefit bitcoin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What is Taproot?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taproot is a soft fork that improves Bitcoin’s scripts to increase privacy and improve upon other factors related to complex transactions on the Bitcoin Network (including timelock releases, multi-signature requirements, and others).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without Taproot, anyone can detect transactions that use those complex functionalities, which require the creation of multiple transactions. However, the Taproot upgrade will make it possible to &#8220;cloak&#8221; all the moving parts of a bitcoin transaction that includes these features, making it look like a single transaction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Taproot makes it possible to hide the fact that a Bitcoin script ran at all. For example, spending Bitcoin using Taproot could make a transaction in a Lightning Network channel, a peer-to-peer transaction, or a sophisticated smart contract become indistinguishable, making anyone monitoring one of these transactions see nothing but a peer-to-peer transaction. It&#8217;s worth noting, though, that this doesn&#8217;t change the fact that the wallets of the initial sender and final recipient will be exposed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taproot is expected to be implemented along with another upgrade called Schnorr signatures. This not only makes Taproot&#8217;s implementation possible but also enables a much-anticipated feature called &#8220;signature aggregation&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What are Schnorr signatures?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schnorr_signature\">Schnorr signatures</a> consist of a cryptographic signature scheme developed by Claus Schnorr – a German mathematician and cryptographer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin currently uses the <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/ECDSA\">ECDSA</a> algorithm to generate cryptographic signatures for a given message and <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1\">secp256k1</a> keypair. Schnorr is an alternative algorithm with several key advantages. One is that when multiple keys are used to sign the same message with Schnorr, the resulting signatures can be combined into a single signature. This means that the signatures from the multiple parties involved in a complex bitcoin transaction can be “aggregated” into a single Schnorr signature &#8211; known as signature aggregation. This can be used to significantly reduce the size of multisig payments and other multisig related transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among a number of other benefits, Schnorr signatures are primarily known for their simplicity and efficiency in generating short signatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Benefits of Taproot for Bitcoin</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When combined with Schnorr signatures, Taproot will bring major improvements to bitcoin’s privacy. This will allow wallets with more complex spending conditions, like a multisig wallet or one that uses time-locking, to no longer be distinguishable from simple single signature wallets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides enhanced privacy, other potential benefits include:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reduced transaction fees &#8211; </strong>The transaction data size for making complex Bitcoin transactions will be dramatically reduced. That means transaction fee costs for using more complex Bitcoin wallet features (such as multisig, or time-locking) will decrease significantly leading to much cheaper transaction fees from your bitcoin multisig wallet.;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More wallet functionality &#8211; </strong>A new type of signature will enhance smart contract functionality in Bitcoin, making it easier and cheaper for users to set more complicated conditions for a transaction.<strong>;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Higher TPS rate &#8211; </strong>More transactions per block.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taproot is one highly anticipated and widely supported upgrade to Bitcoin. It is considered the biggest most important makeover since 2017 and it gets implemented along with Schnorr signatures, we will see significant improvements in terms of privacy, scalability, security, and more. These upgrades can also generate more interest around the Blockchain Network and encourage multisig to be more of an industry standard.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The first bitcoin makeover in four years has been approved by miners around the world!

In other words, it is one of its kind and you can not duplicate it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To read more about what NFTs are read our article: <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-nfts-in-art/\"><strong>Blockchain NFTs in Art</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the steady and rapid rise in popularity and purchases of cryptocurrencies for the past year or so, it should come as no surprise that the NFT market is growing rapidly as well since NFTs can be purchased with crypto. Nowadays more and more people are opting to purchase(buy or sell) these one-of-a-kind tokens and this is provable with some&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>statistics:&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The market cap for global transactions of NFTs was $40.96 million in 2018, $141.56 million in 2019, and $338.04 million in 2020.;</li><li>In 2021, an NFT called &#8220;Everyday&#8217;s: The First 5,000 Days&#8221; by an artist named Beeple was auctioned off for about $69 million.;</li><li>Big-name brands, such as Taco Bell, have started offering NFTs of their own by creating digital collectables for sale.;</li><li>By March 2021, trading volumes for NFTs on Ethereum totalled more than $400 million.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Although a lot of positive things can be said about NFTs, and many people predict that their value will continue to grow over time, there are also critics who have made it a point to alert people to the potential drawbacks of these digital assets which come with such huge price tags. Some critics argue that NFTs are not going to be able to hold their value for the long run and some even go so far as to say that NFTs aren’t worth anything at all. Many even compare them to the early adoption of the internet and that it is just a fad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>But still, what&#8217;s driving people to invest from hundreds of dollars to millions on NFTs?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the impact of the pandemic and distrust in the US dollar created the perfect storm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the start of the pandemic, many people have been saving money and the faith in the US dollar seems to be at an all-time low, which led people to search for new ways of investing. Cryptocurrencies suddenly became something everyone was interested in, automatically turning NFTs from a hobby only for the financial nerds to something fancy and mainstream. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>People have long used art to store value and NFTs just happen to be another more modern approach for people to invest and use it like someone would use gold or Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the idea that one can actually own a piece of creation (music, meme, post, digital painting, game assets, etc) is a whole another level of ownership for fans, collectors and enthusiasts which makes NFTs the perfect solution for owning something you really like or you think will be more valuable with time, or as Rodriguez-Fraile once said : </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>NFTs can represent the future of the art world.</p><p> A few years from now this could just be how people own art.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing is, NFT’s boom was accelerated by the pandemic, but ultimately it was inevitable as it is a product of the new tech that younger generations would have eventually driven into anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>But what about their value?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some critics believe NFTs are operating under a bubble, even Mike Winkelmann, aka <a href=\"https://www.beeple-crap.com/\">Beeple</a>, once said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If it&#8217;s not a bubble now, I do believe it probably will be a bubble at some point because there are just so many people rushing into this space.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is, there&#8217;s always a chance that a tech frenzy is a passing fad or is stoking a speculative bubble. If you spend a pretty penny on an NFT and then enthusiasm and values suddenly plummet, you could be in for a big loss. But NFT backers say the system&#8217;s built-in scarcity should keep values up, as long as the surge of interest persists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the risks with value are basically the same as in the regular market. If someone is willing to pay thousands of dollars for a <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/why-a-banana-duct-taped-to-a-wall-sold-for-120-000-1.4719724\">banana taped to a wall</a>, then that is modern, interesting and is considered art. The price covering of NFTs art is working with the same mechanism as the regular art, only a bit fancier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you get when you buy an NFT?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you are a fan of Beeple&#8217;s work and you want to own artwork from him. Now, what you will actually &#8220;own&#8221; if you purchase let&#8217;s say &#8220;<a href=\"https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/100010001\">Crossroads</a>&#8221; for example, is not the creation itself, but rather a token that connects your name with the creator&#8217;s art on the blockchain. In other words, you’re paying for an extremely small digital record (likely only a few bytes in size, which often contains a URL or a serial number) that’s sent to your address on the blockchain. That’s it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you buy an NFT you gain the rights to the unique token (but only on the blockchain). So you can own it on the blockchain, but you have no control over rights to its distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the digital non-fungible tokens operate on the same deflationary principles as bitcoin. NFTs cannot be duplicated, can be easily authenticated, and are immutable. This motivates people to buy NFTs because it provides a unique connection to the creator that does not exist with any other art form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying NFTs is all about scarcity. Blockchain provides proof of ownership and guarantees you that a specific item is unique &#8211; kind of like a certificate of authenticity and if you own that NFT, nobody else can own it unless you sell (or give) it to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, even though NFTs are essentially just a code that identifies a digital asset and its owner, they have quickly become collectors’ items, with people willing to spend hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars to stake their claim to a file. The fact that these digital assets are scarce helps them maintain their value, and that’s also one of the reasons why they cost so much money. Whether they will continue to grow in popularity and usage or eventually become a thing of the past is something that’s yet to be seen.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Simply put, NFT stands for a non-fungible token which is a digital asset that is distinctive from the others out [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"18","title":"Blockchain and Business","path":"/category/blockchain-and-business/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-06-07T10:20:20","id":"3242","title":"Stablecoin Explained","path":"/blog/stablecoin-explained/","content":"\n<p>Cryptocurrencies such as <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/bitcoin-101/what-is-bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> and <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/ethereum-101/what-is-ethereum\">Ethereum</a> offer a number of benefits, and one of the most fundamental is not requiring trust in an intermediary institution to send payments, which opens up their use to anyone around the world. But one key drawback is that cryptocurrencies’ prices are unpredictable and have a tendency to vary, sometimes widely and rapidly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>So, what is stablecoin?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“A Stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A stablecoin is a digital asset that remains stable in value against a pegged external traditional asset class. It reduces the price volatility by backing its value against a conventional asset, such as a combination of currencies, a single fiat currency, or other valuable assets. Stablecoins aim to create a stable and reliable environment to increase cryptocurrencies&#8217; adoption and negate digital assets&#8217; speculative nature. They offer the best of both worlds — security and decentralization of cryptocurrencies, with fiat currencies&#8217; stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>But, why the need for stablecoins?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-2-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3260\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-2-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-2-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-2.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Adopting cryptocurrencies as a direct replacement for conventional fiat currency requires stability; else the volatile currency can compromise the purchasing power of a holder. With Stablecoins one has no need to worry about volatility or instability of cryptocurrencies prices and can guarantee:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Little to no volatility &#8211; </strong>The price of cryptocurrencies doesn&#8217;t fluctuate as frequently as popular cryptos like Bitcoin or Ether.;</li><li><strong>Global payment and remittance &#8211; </strong>Cross-border transactions with stablecoins are faster, cheaper, and more efficient than the traditional methods. They are not only costly but also take days to clear a single international payment. That is a lot of unnecessary weight and fees for payments, which could be simplified using stablecoins.;</li><li><strong>Protecting cryptocurrency traders &#8211; </strong>Stablecoins also protects traders and investors during volatile markets. In a bear market, they can protect their position by flipping their Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies to a stablecoin within seconds.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Types of stablecoin</strong>:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fiat-collateralized stablecoins</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Fiat-collateralized stablecoins are, as the name suggests, backed by sovereign currency such as the pound or the US dollar. These are the most common types of stablecoins backed at a 1:1 ratio, meaning one stablecoin can be exchanged with one unit of currency. For each stablecoin that exists, there is fiat currency held in the treasury to back it up. The aim is to back a stablecoin by real fiat in real bank accounts. Though this stablecoin&#8217;s category is most simple, it is the most centralized, too. A central entity acts as the fiat reserve custodian and manages the whole process of issuing fiat-backed tokens and receiving new fiats.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Crypto-Backed stablecoins</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A crypto-backed stablecoin operates just like a fiat-backed stablecoin. However, instead of using fiat as collateral, cryptocurrencies are locked up as collateral that backs up the crypto-backed stablecoin. The token used to back the stablecoin uses a &#8216;security pledge&#8217; to compensate for the price fluctuation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Non-Collateralized (Algorithmic) stablecoin</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-collateralized stablecoins are those that do not involve the use of any reserve asset. Instead, their stability is derived from an algorithm-generated mechanism (or smart contracts)</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Commodity-backed stablecoins</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Interchangeable assets, like precious metals, back commodity-backed stablecoins. The most common commodity used to back these stablecoins is gold, but they can also be backed by real estate, oil, or other precious metals. The collateral is often stored in a vault of a trusted third party. The stablecoins entitle a purchase to redeem the coin with a commodity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Most popular stablecoins</strong>:</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Tether</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tether.to/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Tether</a> is one of the oldest stablecoins, launched in 2014, and is the most popular to this day. It’s currently one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies overall by market capitalization and its primary use case is moving money between exchanges quickly and taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities when the price of cryptocurrencies differs on two exchanges. Traders can make money on this discrepancy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Diem</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.diem.com/en-us/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Diem</a> is a stablecoin in the works, originally conceived by the worldwide social media platform Facebook. Initially, the Diem Association, the consortium set up by Facebook, said Diem would be backed by a “basket” of currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the euro. But due to global regulatory concerns, the association has since backed off from its ambitious original vision. Instead, it is now planning to focus on developing multiple stablecoins, each backed by a separate national currency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>USD Coin</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Launched in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.centre.io/usdc\" class=\"rank-math-link\">USD Coin</a> is a stablecoin managed jointly by the cryptocurrency firms Circle and Coinbase through the Centre consortium. Like Tether, USD Coin is pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Dai</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Running on the MakerDAO protocol, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/price/dai\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Dai</a> is a stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Created in 2015, the cryptocurrency aims to keep its value as close to one United States dollar (USD) as possible through an automated system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Dai is maintained and regulated by <a href=\"https://makerdao.com/en/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">MakerDAO</a>, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) composed of the owners of its governance token, who may vote on changes to certain parameters in its smart contracts in order to ensure the stability of Dai.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>DOGEO</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-2-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3261\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-2-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-2-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-2.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dogecoin.com/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Dogecoin</a> was created in 2013 purely as a joke to reference the internet&#8217;s favourite Shiba Inu dog <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"rank-math-link\">meme</a>. Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\" class=\"rank-math-link\">DOGE</a>) is expected to soon be available for use as collateral in minting the dollar-pegged $DOGEO stable coin at <a href=\"http://opendao.io\">OpenDAO</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The future of stablecoins</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stablecoins have existed in the cryptocurrency space for a few years, but only gained prominence in the last year or so. Even though they are relatively new their purpose can go way beyond being just a financial contract.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are talking here about the evolution of the traditional payment system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is now a new form of digital money controlled algorithmically instead of a central authority that offers similar monetary benefits as fiat currencies. Stablecoins have the potential to open new doors to the mainstream adoption of digital assets in our day-to-day life, changing the global payment landscape (for good).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, stablecoins are in their infancy, and it may take a while before we see them used in the digital space, but it sure sounds like they are here to stay.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum offer a number of benefits, and one of the most fundamental is not requiring [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"18","title":"Blockchain and Business","path":"/category/blockchain-and-business/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-06-01T10:55:43","id":"3203","title":"What matters more: Blockchain or Bitcoin?","path":"/blog/what-matters-more-blockchain-or-bitcoin/","content":"\n<h3><strong>A very very brief definition</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain</a> is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrency (among other things). <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Bitcoin</a> is the name of the best-known cryptocurrency, the one for which blockchain technology was invented.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>So, the question is:&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>What matters more: the technology or the creation, which this technology was invented for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer this question first, and foremost, we have to compare the two<strong> </strong>on a general indicator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see what potentials and benefits Blockchain and Bitcoin have, we have to consider their impact on a specific, real-world environment. We choose the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Financial System</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bitcoin Potential&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To explain Bitcoin we have to think of it as software. A software program that allows people to securely transfer money over the internet without a bank institution. It does this by replacing the function of a bank with a network of computers running the software that verifies and transfers the money. These computers, known as miners, maintain a global ledger of transactions that are used to validate, verify and transfer money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin’s most important potential is that it takes the global ledger of transactions out of the control of the banking system and distributes it onto every computer that is connected to the Bitcoin network. This means that the financial behemoths no longer control the system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Bitcoin, the users of the financial system are in control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin accomplishes this disruption not just by using blockchain technology but also with the global decentralized currency &#8211; bitcoin.&nbsp;The currency &#8220;bitcoin&#8221; is the motivation for anyone in the world to run the software that changes the way the financial system works. Banks cherish blockchain because they get to continue to maintain the ledger of transactions by running the software on their own computers.&nbsp;But bitcoin creates competition for the banks in the form of anyone with a computer and an internet connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without the currency, there would be no incentive for people to spend money on computers and hardware needed to run the Bitcoin software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain without Bitcoin mimics the same financial system already in existence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blockchain Potential</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From a financial perspective, it’s easier to think of blockchain technology also as some kind of next-generation financial process improvement software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized technology, such as blockchain, promises the ability to improve the financial processes that occur between parties, radically lowering the “cost of trust” and drastically increasing the efficiency and transparency factors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology has the potential to provide a much faster, cheaper, and more efficient alternative to traditional cross-border payment methods. Indeed, while typical money remittance costs might be as high as 20% of the transfer amount, blockchain allows for costs just a fraction of that, as well as guaranteed and real-time transaction processing speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Smart Contracts</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts are another highly powerful application of blockchain technology for the financial sector. Their potential applications are essentially limitless and can oversee all aspects of an agreement, from facilitation to execution. When conditions are met, smart contracts can be self-executing and self-enforcing allowing a more secure, more automated alternative to traditional contract law as well as providing an application that is faster and cheaper than the traditional methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Security</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most problematic areas of the digital age has been identity security. The financial sector is one of the many institutions maintaining online personal information and securing private information. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is known to offer a tremendous level of security, thanks to the independent verification processes that take place throughout member computers on a blockchain network called &#8220;<a href=\"https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-blockchain-consensus-algorithm\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Consensus mechanisms</a>&#8220;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, you may wonder how a consensus is achieved if these networks are composed of individual nodes operated by independent people or organizations, separated geographically and independent of each other or any central authority. How is it possible to reliably know which nodes are supplying faulty information about transactions — either maliciously or by accident?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, <em><a href=\"https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/byzantine-fault-tolerance-explained\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Byzantine Fault Tolerance </a>(BFT) </em>refers to the property of a distributed computer system that allows it to overcome this problem and consistently form consensus regardless of the fact that some nodes disagree with the rest, either accidentally or on purpose. This can be achieved by applying <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Proof-of-Work</a> or (the most recent one) <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Proof-of-Stake</a> algorithms which allow the decentralized system to ultimately determine the level of security, speed and scalability of the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This mechanism could just easily be applied to many types of verification procedures, including identity verification and many other applications regarding financial systems. To fulfil security requirements blockchain technology makes use of public-key cryptography to grant an ownership tool that is also referred to as the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">private key</a>. The cryptography that secures blockchain is deemed to be powerful enough to give it the qualities of being tamper-proof and immutable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to point out that blockchain cannot exist outside a network of computers, which automatically eliminates most system risks that are mainly associated with centralized systems. The benefits of storing data across peer-to-peer networks guarantee security and immutability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>So what does it all mean?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering the potentials that Blockchain and Bitcoin bring to just one industry&#8230; it&#8217;s safe to say that one cannot live without the other. By combining them together in one synergy, we might witness the creation of a self–sustaining independent financial system that has never existed in the modern financial world before. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, it&#8217;s likely that financial experts and many others in the investing world will encounter blockchain technology much more in the years to come, whether it is linked with a specific cryptocurrency or if it&#8217;s being utilized in a number of other applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can end this article with Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey&#8217;s words &#8220;Blockchain and Bitcoin point to a future, and point to a world, where content exists forever, where it’s permanent, where it doesn’t go away and it exists forever on every single node that’s connected to it.&#8221;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>A very very brief definition Blockchain is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrency (among other things).

While there were almost two billion video gamers across the world in 2016, this figure is expected to rise to over three billion gamers by 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are exposed to millions of games, spanning across multiple genres and platforms that give players the ultimate satisfaction of winning and progressing. Behind many of these games are teams of psychologies and developers that implement novelties and technologies to give the users the best realistic experience of gaming, making games more addictive and influential than ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is no wonder that the gaming industry is worth billions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just look at virtual reality. That s**t is gettin’ crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since the gaming industry can be considered one of the most technologically savvy.. it should come as no surprise when we talk about Blockchain Gaming. There are now games developed on Blockchains like <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Ethereum</a> and <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Monero</a>. Others implement Blockchain partially, for storing data or in-game assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first things, first!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Why does gaming need blockchain?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Trust and transparency issue</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, as the industry grows, new problems emerge. We wouldn&#8217;t have had the need to address problems like lack of transparency and trust in games, a decade ago, but with virtual reality (VR) and 5G data streaming capabilities became part of gaming, everything is closer to real-life than ever, turning them into a warehouse of emotion-churning, engrossing games that reward precision and planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those games are often invented with twisted plots where characters (like Super Mario) don&#8217;t just die while chasing some distant goal like a princess in a castle. Instead, players build up and customize characters by trading and buying assets that can be purchased with real-world money as an in-game purchase or earned as the player progresses in the game in order to level up and complete missions. It is like games have an economy inside them, which is completely controlled by the developers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gamers want fairness and transparency when it comes to transactions and ownership of assets, so games need to become more neutral for players who work hard or spend their money to acquire them(guns, props, environments, cars, planes, characters, and art). But since these assets are virtual, game developers can just produce an unlimited amount or rig the market by providing them to certain players, which contradicts the meaning of the games &#8211; to be fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where Blockchain comes!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain enables the tokenization of these assets and the creation of decentralized gaming asset markets. Since the ledger is open for everyone to check and verify, this increases the trust factor. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Security</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaming platforms are mainly hosted on centralized servers and transactions are often made on mobile devices or computers without adequate security measures. Also, assets held in gaming accounts are prone to be stolen. They are not as secure as bank accounts, however valuable a gaming account can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is designed to be unhackable and is known for being the most secure way of storing value. By storing digital gaming assets on a blockchain a player would enhance the security of them and would have to worry if those hours of effort were in vain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Games on Blockchain</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Games are a great way to hook someone on new technology and for those who want to feel the nature of Blockchain, there are games developed entirely on Blockchain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://axieinfinity.com/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Axie Infinity</a> is one of the longest-standing and most popular games on Ethereum where you collect creatures, raise them, breed them, and battle them. It has very cute graphics and it can answer the question “What would CryptoKitties be like if you could do more than just breed them?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Axie Infinity isn’t a ground-breaking use of blockchain, but it’s the best at what it does and is an accessible entry-level game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://decentraland.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Decentraland</a> is another game on Ethereum that launched in early 2020. The game is a decentralized virtual world that has much to offer, including unique avatars, events, custom buildings and items, and seasonal quests. Everything within the game is owned by the player, from the clothes that you create and wear to the very land that you walk on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the thing is..there is no need to put everything on-chain to reap the rewards of blockchain tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Web-1920-–-6-1-1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Web-1920-–-6-1-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Web-1920-–-6-1-1-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Web-1920-–-6-1-1-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Web-1920-–-6-1-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Web-1920-–-6-1-1.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What goes on-chain?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, the optimum system makes use of elements both on and off-chain, working combined to provide all the benefits of blockchain in a way that is feasible within current technical boundaries and safeguards the commercial sensitivities of operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game developers can still keep hold of proprietary information and game logic, running this off-chain for the company&#8217;s privacy reasons. On-chain, player profiles and data, as well as game information, can be stored for the sake of those key benefits &#8211; transparency and visibility. The combination of on-chain data, derived from off-chain game logic and interactions, makes for a model that is perfect for meeting the needs of the gaming sector, for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lets not forget one very important thing!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ownership of in-game assets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>То encourage longer playtime, developers implemented rewards for players who put in hours and hours of effort to achieve a certain objective. But despite investing time and hard-earned money into the game, the players do not own the digital assets they have built up. Developers hold the power to change or remove items as they see fit which makes players merely licensees of their product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the new blockchain-enabled development focuses on transferring the ownership of in-game assets from developers to players. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Games are even starting to flip the script and enabling players to be the true owners of their in-game assets. This is facilitated by smart contracts which mean that ownership of the digital asset is automatically passed to the player when a certain predefined condition is met (such as purchasing the asset or completing challenges). Since the data on a blockchain is immutable, the smart contract cannot be reversed by the developer. This presents a number of opportunities for players to monetize their skills and progress. For example, a tournament winner could sell or auction off their game-winning tool. With blockchain, you can trace the history of each in-game asset – and owning some champion tools would be like owning a piece of historic sports memorabilia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Closing thought</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The intersection of blockchain and gaming is an interesting world where lifelike reality is possible in a virtual world. With advances in VR, this world is more likely to be even more integrated with our real-world experience than we can imagine right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are witnessing a revolution in gaming and blockchain. Combined, they will create an ecosystem that works seamlessly,taking gaming to a completly new level.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The video gaming industry is huge and shows no signs of slowing down.

Trust and transparency remain a significant issue for some players, and for operators, the gaming experience is reliant on often centralized systems, that are themselves vulnerable to manipulation and hacking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where blockchain comes in!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantages of blockchain and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/smart-contracts-vs-traditional-contracts/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">smart contracts</a> can solve many issues regarding safety and fair game, as the technology allows to record anonymously user actions and game results; Faster transaction speed, because clients of blockchain-based resources can withdraw or deposit funds without waiting for several days; Anonymity, as blockchain-based crypto casinos guarantee that player personal information won’t be disseminated and more&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why does gambling need blockchain, and what are the advantages of the technology?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What benefits could blockchain offer the gambling industry?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology offers a number of unique advantages over other systems that make it such a perfect fit for gambling:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Transparency</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there’s the transparency angle. In blockchain systems, data is written automatically to a distributed ledger, which by definition provides an immutable, trusted source of truth. Blockchain gaming data can be relied upon by operators, players, and regulators, all of whom can access the same data in real-time which is helpful for resolving player trust issues and the disputes that inevitably arise along the way. But it’s also incredibly useful for operators meeting their compliance requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Security</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main opportunities blockchain provides is enhanced security. With data held on the blockchain theoretically unhackable and totally secure, information can, automatically, be considered no longer vulnerable to fraud. The decentralized nature of the technology ensures secure transactions as well as prevents data from being changed or deleted. So the history of victories and payments is not only open but also well-protected and immutable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Improved Payout Process</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As for payments, the process of withdrawal has always been a challenge. In order to get the money, one could face the necessity to deal with different documents and intermediaries as well as time delays.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology introduces smart contracts to the gambling industry. These are programs that perform certain actions (eg. money transfer) when the required conditions are met.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, blockchain technology allows faster transaction speed as payments are conducted directly, without third parties and there is no need for clients to wait several days to withdraw their money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, empowered by blockchain, the process of getting money becomes fast, cheap and simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Cryptocurrency Availability&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the public mind, blockchain has always been known for cryptocurrencies and in the case of gambling, it is an appropriate association. Implementation of crypto in the betting and gambling services can widen the audience and helps to get rid of third-party intermediaries like banks or payment services.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Audience Expansion</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>People related to the industry believe that blockchain will help to make gambling more socially acceptable and, as a result, attract more users to blockchain-based betting platforms and casinos. This is the effect of the benefits we mentioned above: security, cryptocurrency availability, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-1024x445.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2999\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-1024x445.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-300x130.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-768x334.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-1536x667.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-1038x451.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What challenges does the gambling industry face with blockchain?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, things like anonymity can be regarded as a two-edged sword. For example, the fact that transactions can’t be traced to the real user, if no KYC is required, opens the door to the very same criminal activity the industry is trying to prevent nowadays. While blockchain services are hailed for anonymity, this feature isn’t likely to sit well with regulations. How would anonymous gambling allow for effective age checks, anti-money laundering processes, and self-exclusion facilities? These questions are fair to ask and are not something the technology is not capable of solving &#8211; for example via Zero-Knowledge Proof based systems, which would allow the user to prove they are old enough to participate in the betting platform without revealing sensitive and/or private information to the whole world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people consider the investment in bitcoin as the same as gambling in a casino. However, while gambling on games like roulette often requires an understanding of roulette odds and strategy play successfully, a similarly considered approach to investing in cryptocurrency might be futile. This is due to its sheer volatility, which can drastically drop its value in a single day. The challenge &#8211; price volatility. All cryptocurrencies, with no exceptions, are prone to price change. The value of a single unit of currency changes on a day-to-day basis exactly because the blockchain is ungoverned and decentralized. This creates a feeling of insecurity in many users and casino players, thus making them reluctant to even get started with the technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The very nature of the technology allows players to improve the fairness and transparency of online gambling. However, the regulatory issues involved in introducing blockchain could prove to be the biggest stumbling block companies face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, some places are already starting to adopt laws that allow casinos and gambling operators to accept cryptocurrencies as legal tender. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gambling Commission has already accepted that cryptocurrencies can be used for gambling. This is because it’s classed as ‘money or money’s worth’ in the Gambling Act 2005. But it has expressed concerns about how well casinos will be able to put effective controls in place that manage the various risks involved with these cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If these regulatory challenges can be overcome, it’s highly likely we’ll witness blockchain being more regularly adopted to audit, monitor, and record different parts  – from the players and operators to the games themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the potential challenges and controversies involved, blockchain is an emerging technology that cannot be ignored, particularly in technology-based businesses like online casinos. Over the next ten years or so, experts predict that blockchain will transform almost every industry – including gambling, as blockchain allows gambling to rapidly advance and enter new levels of trust-based customer relations and guarantees fair gaming, which is quite important for the industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So stay tuned!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain is already shaping the future of many industries (for the better) and is set to be the next big [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"18","title":"Blockchain and Business","path":"/category/blockchain-and-business/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-04-02T12:06:04","id":"2954","title":"How Blockchain is taking over the world [2021]","path":"/blog/how-blockchain-is-taking-over-the-world-2021/","content":"\n<p>Blockchain technology has to be one of the biggest innovations of the past decade. Considering it’s something that began with mere cryptocurrency, now  – it has a ripple effect on several important sectors, from manufacturing, <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain-2/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">supply chain</a> to Fintech, <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-art/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Art</a>, and education.<br>Many predict it is going to transform the nature of transactions, trading across the world, as well as transform the way we manage data, both internally and externally between parties, and most importantly build trust, transparency and change our worldview. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what makes blockchain so attractive to businesses and different industries? How is still continuing to be so hyped and controversial? And most importantly, why are there so many applications being developed on the Blockchain?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is simple &#8211; It’s because of its benefits. Blockchain offers indisputable traceability, distributed collaboration capabilities, trust, and rapid updates to support managing data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend is evidenced by ever-growing global investment in blockchain solutions, which is forecast to reach US$15.9 billion in 2023, ten times more than the $1.5 billion invested in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Southeast Asia, businesses are feeling optimistic too, with 45% of companies believing that blockchain technology growth will accelerate with more applications and opportunities over the next three to five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let’s look at more recent events &#8211; <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/crypto\">PayPal’s adoption of Bitcoin</a> late last year is not only heralding mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies but of blockchain’s utility in an era in which remote collaboration is prized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year has been off to a notable start for crypto and blockchain. On Jan. 7 the total cryptocurrency market hit an all-time high exceeding $1 trillion for the first time. Renewed interest in and conversations around, blockchain technology and digital currencies from industry and government leaders have accompanied the rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s new is that blockchain interoperability has gotten better, the technology itself has matured, and vendors have significantly stepped up their efforts in this area, making it more accessible and ready to take over the world for good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we made a list of&nbsp; some trends blockchain is most likely to follow in 2021:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Supply Chain Optimization</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing supply chains is crucial especially in the area of goods flow and logistics as the industries are known for their paper-heavy processes and struggle with many challenges in day-to-day business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of international goods traffic, it is often a wide variety of systems, manual work, and cross-border specifications that make the work of logisticians and partners more difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimized supply chains do not just refer to the cost-optimized shipment of good or raw materials from A to B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long distances, many partners, large volumes of documents and data, and mutual trust can be optimally mapped digitally with blockchains and various applications. As a distributed ledger, the technology is ideally suited to managing large volumes of data raw materials that can be tracked from their origin and grant digital certificates the authenticity or accuracy of information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The integration of DLT in supply chain management is one of the top blockchain trends in 2021 because, on the one hand, the consumer’s need for transparency is growing and on the other hand, the barrier-free supply of goods across all borders ensures greater security, trust and economic stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DeFi Adoption</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/defi-decentralized-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) is experiencing a new wave of excitement and adoption since mid-December(2020) after the DeFi summer blossom. The value of DeFi tokens hit new highs, bolstering awareness of DeFi within the crypto community while <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/traditional-vs-decentralized-fundraising-models/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">attracting new users from traditional finance</a> (TraFi), enabling private small investors to enter the financial world, turning millions of people into investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Blockchain provides numerous approaches for DeFi adoption in different fields, ranging from trading, lending, derivatives, to the introduction of automated market makers. These clear winners of DeFi’s adoption have become prime targets for everyone who&#8217;s trying to take advantage of their innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Certificate verification via the blockchain</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The validity and timeliness of certificates are the basis for trust between business partners. Certificates using blockchain technology are tamper-proof and can be viewed transparently by every participant in the network. Providers of these solutions thus ensure that audits and certification, for example, can be carried out successfully. However, the digital certificates can also be proof of ownership or proof of origin. Once stored, anyone can access the relevant information with a QR code, ensuring efficient processes and user convenience during audits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital certificates are a blockchain trend 2021, as they prevent misuse and provide consumers and partners with security and trust for future business relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>DEXes (Decentralized Exchanges)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to exchanging crypto, many have long been focused on centralized players like Binance or Coinbase largely due to their fiat onramps and ease of use. Despite these notions, many have been quick to point out that centralized exchanges come with their own inherent risks – namely those of custody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Famously highlighted by hacks on once-prominent exchanges, many traders have come to recognize the value of non-custodial solutions offered by decentralized exchanges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past year alone, DEXs have made serious improvements in both usability and liquidity – signaling that they are ready to compete with their goliath counterparts. Here are some of the DEXes’s characteristics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Non-custodial</em> – Ownership of the underlying assets is never revoked.</li><li><em>Automated</em> – With no intermediaries, DEX trading is instantaneous so long as there is sufficient liquidity.</li><li><em>Cost-Efficient</em> – Many DEXs have minimal trading fees, allowing users to swap assets at little to no cost</li><li><em>Globally Accessible</em> – Most DEXs do not require any sign-ups, and largely come with no counterparty risk.</li><li><em>Intuitive</em> – Newer trends have evolved DEX trading from order books to simple point and click swaps.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>DEXes are definitely one of the blockchain trends in 2021, as the traffic and trading volume of existing providers is increasing month by month and people are starting to look for new options for trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>NFTs — Non-Fungible Tokens</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2965\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-Fungible Tokens are on the rise and quickly gaining popularity across games, art, and music digital asset exchanges, and blockchain platforms. NFTs enable digital scarcity, meaning a single copy of a unique digital asset can be stored within an NFT and can’t be replicated. NFTs were originally popularized by the game Crypto Kitties but since then many <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-nfts-in-art/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">digital art projects</a> and startups have established themselves in the NFTs world. In-game assets can be digitized and exchanged using NFTs, the same applies to music and audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital rights management is definitely another space which is set for disruption using non fungible tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tokenization of bonds — STOs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>STOs are a type of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_offering\" class=\"rank-math-link\">public offering</a> in which tokenized digital securities, known as security tokens, are sold in cryptocurrency exchanges, or security token exchanges. Tokens can be used to trade real financial assets such as equities and fixed income. After crypto-tokens, security tokens are something to look at in 2021 because they are fully regulated and represent digital assets that comply with securities regulators&#8217; basic regulations. The offerings are securities that have been approved by the authorities and are therefore also subject to the prospectus requirement, which must clearly state the funding objective. This is because they involve financing rounds in which equity or debt capital is to be generated. They may be carried out by any company that complies with securities regulations. STOs, give the buyers a share of the company’s profits in return for the loan they extend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to traditional investments, however, STOs offer significantly higher returns and interest rates, making them particularly attractive to investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The immense potential for the next few years is likely to lie in the fact that STOs do not require intermediaries&#8217; assistance. The much leaner structure, therefore, offers greater profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have recently emerged as a hot topic in the financial space. Banks, Institutions, and governments are performing research and analysis on the economic and technical feasibility of introducing a new form of digital money and its impact on monetary and fiscal policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Bank of International Settlements <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap107.htm\" class=\"rank-math-link\">report</a> states that over 80% of central banks are already researching CBDC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are even countries that experimenting with CBDCs.:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The People&#8217;s Bank of China is one of the first central banks to develop a CBDC. They deployed a special task force in 2014 to research and implement a digital Yuan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, the world&#8217;s oldest bank, Swedish Riksbank, began its CBDC project called e-krona. In 2019, the Bahamas also began their CBDC project called &#8220;Sand Dollar&#8221; — it was fully deployed in October 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, the Republic of the Marshall Islands shared plans for launching a CBDC called Sovereign (SOV).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are still many uncertainties concerning control, liquidity, and more, central bank money is definitely one of the Blockchain Trends in 2021 because it is only a matter of time before digital money becomes mass adoption.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the important trends one can watch out for in the coming years. From making a food supply chain safer and smarter to transforming legacy processes, blockchain leaders are leading the business world into a new era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The future of distributed ledger technology and blockchain is rapidly changing. Mainstream adoption of blockchain is surely coming and we will see continued interest from, both the consumer and enterprise levels around the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what happens in 2021,&nbsp; be sure to hold on tight because it is going to be a wild year and one for the books.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain technology has to be one of the biggest innovations of the past decade.

Basically, Cryptokitties was the first enormous boom of the craze for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long story short, in September 2020, Christie’s auction house announced the sale of a digital portrait of the Bitcoin code for more than $130,000. It was the first time a non-fungible token was auctioned at one of the major auction houses for traditional art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly we all started reading news about Grimes who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56252738\" class=\"rank-math-link\">sold some of her digital art for more than $6m</a>&nbsp;or about <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Nyan Cat being sold as one</a>, or on March 11, 2021, the most expensive digital art sale was made &#8211; Christie&#8217;s sold their first digital work of art, Beeple&#8217;s <a href=\"https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924\" class=\"rank-math-link\">&#8220;EVERYDAY: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS&#8221;</a> for a whopping $69.3 million.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And by the time we all thought we sort of knew what the deal was, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables\">the founder of Twitter put an autographed tweet</a> up for sale as an NFT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve seen any of this news and still wondered, <em>okay so what even is an NFT?</em> here is an explanation we give:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What are NFTs?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NFT stands for &#8220;non-fungible token.&#8221; We can explain this word by word.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, a “fungible” asset refers to something that is interchangeable with another unit of that same asset. A good example of a fungible asset is the US dollar. If I exchange my $1 bill for your $1 bill, nothing really changes. While they are two different pieces of fancy paper, both bills represent the same exact value. That’s fungibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, a “<em>non</em>-fungible” asset refers to something of a distinct value. There are no two exact same things. A good example of a non-fungible asset is the painting of the Mona Lisa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A “non-fungible <em>token”</em> is where things get really interesting. Here is where we bring on the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/blockchain-software-development/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">blockchain</a>. The first and so far most popular of these implementations is the creation and distribution of fungible and non-fungible tokens. A non-fungible token allows us to create a digital certificate that represents a unique asset. This allows us to create proofs of authenticity for digital content that can be owned, bought, sold and traded. Because these tokens are stored on an open and distributed blockchain (such as Ethereum), their embedded metadata and transaction history are completely verifiable by anyone in the world with an Internet connection. That means we can all know what digital wallets own what tokens at any given point in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can attach these tokens to pretty much anything, including digital files— a photo, a video, an audio recording, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The implications of NFTs are truly infinite, and we’ve just begun to scratch the surface of possibilities. So far, non-fungible tokens are being used to create industries around digital art, collectibles, gaming skins, digital land, and many many more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How are artists selling their work on the Blockchain?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And now as we have a clearer conception of what NFTs are, let us jump into the now-exploding world of NFTs and Art.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you have created some really cool digital sticker, or Photoshop picture, or meme (whatever is more convenient to you) and you upload it onto the Internet space. Boom, now everyone can drag it and download it, which automatically makes hundreds and thousands of copies of your artwork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is up until the advent of NFTs. This time, after creating your artwork, you <em>mint </em>it on the blockchain — a fancy way of saying that you turn it into an NFT. This process differs from site to site, but it can be done on platforms like <a href=\"https://niftygateway.com/become-creator\">Nifty Gateway</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now there is a one on one proof of authenticity certificate for your work that exists on the Ethereum blockchain, securely housed in your digital wallet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose to put it up for sale, and anyone can bid on it or buy it right away at a listed price.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>But what’s the point?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since this piece of art is created and exists on a screen (be it phone, computer, tablet, etc). It can still be seen, screen-shotted, dragged, downloaded, and shared by anyone online. So the initial reaction will be <em>“Why would anyone want to buy digital art if it still can be used and copied by many?”</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we suggest copying is good, sharing is great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take an example &#8211; The Scream is a masterpiece by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch which everybody knows. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1500387364-1024x680.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2879\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1500387364-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1500387364-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1500387364-768x510.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1500387364-868x576.jpg 868w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1500387364.jpg 1190w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>The Scream &#8211; Edvard Munch</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been turned into a meme, used and shared by many. The plan is &#8211; the more shares it has over the Internet the more this work of art’s cultural relevance continues to grow, and the more value the original painting has.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the basic idea is that your artwork can be screen-shot and used the same way The Scream can be photoed and used, but that does not mean one claims provenance. The deeper concept of NFT art is agreed-upon value and ownership; even if anyone can see,<em> </em>download, print out, and hang up a piece of digital art, only a select few can actually own that exact piece, and that ownership is recorded on a blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s key to know that when buying an NFT one gains the rights to the unique token, but only on the blockchain. So when you buy a piece of art, you own it on the blockchain, but you have no control over rights to its distribution. When you buy an NFT in most cases you&#8217;re not buying content, but rather a token that connects your name with the creator&#8217;s art on the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why buy NFTs?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the NFT trend picks up steam, it&#8217;s also drawing in curious new buyers — people who never thought could afford a piece of art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing in art has traditionally been the reserve of the upper-classes who can afford to invest in something that is likely to lose value. Crypto art could provide a way for those with less capital to invest in works, financially supporting artists you like, gives you some basic usage rights, plus, you don&#8217;t have to think about where to put it when you buy it. 😀</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, fractionalizing is an increasingly popular way to buy art in recent years, as it allows owners to buy shares in the same piece. The same argument for NFTs being less risky also applies to why it could be ideal for tokenization. Through blockchain technology, fractionalization can actually be part of the digital artwork itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2920\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-1-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-1-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-1.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many questions are raised “Will NFTs end up being a passing fad?”; “Is it a bubble?” “Maybe a hype?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe all of them or maybe it&#8217;s the next big thing.

Gaming, Supply Chain Music, and Art were some of the industries that were covered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;NFTs have a lot of uncovered potentials.</p><p>It was very interesting to follow different art, designer and digital creators, starting to embrace NFTs as a new way to monetize their work as blockchain is becoming more accessible to a wider audience.”</p><cite>Milen</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed the element of subjectivity in art and&nbsp; Who decides what is the value of an art piece that is an&nbsp; NFTs of some sort?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Well, basically, market, just like in the regular space, if someone is willing to pay.</p><p> A banana taped to a wall for $120 000, if someone is willing to pay for that, then that is the price. The price covering the NFTs art is working with the same mechanism as the regular art only a bit fancier&#8221;.</p><cite>Luka</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the key moments were when discussing existential and pragmatic questions like how digital art is going to be presented to the world, how you will “hang it”&nbsp; and how the trend should be set.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about virtual space where you hang it in the middle of your wallet, it&#8217;s because the first thing somebody does is check out your wallets. And to see what are you holding crypto, and also NFTs. So, it&#8217;s like, inviting people to your house to see your artwork, but in your wallet.” </p><cite>Luka</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Or just imagine some virtual museum tours around digital art emerging out of this non-fungible tokens hype. So I think this from one side, it&#8217;s too difficult to grasp from the traditional art that we&#8217;re used to seeing. But from other perspectives, it brings up a lot of new models that may emerge as businesses and as ways to communicate or to cherish or see art in general.” </p><cite>Milen</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest lies within your imagination 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We debated about what is behind the hype and why there is hype behind it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;And my opinion is that it represents a unique way of earning money for people who were basically, we have gatekeepers all around them, musicians, artists gaming, but anything that is expressive, which was unable to be directly monetized, and now it&#8217;s monetizable.”</p><cite>Luka</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We concluded that every generation has something of its own. Now real artists have many new exchanges and platforms that are emerging that are allowing them to create or trade or invest in portfolios. Now, after several years of development, the user interfaces and the whole user journey and flow are smoother than it was once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But still,  there is a lot more to go. And we think that&#8217;s also a topic to be brought up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this the optimal way to use NFTs? Or should it be more simple for people or users or regular non-tech people? For example, someone that is not technically advanced? Why shouldn&#8217;t they use NFT&#8217;s in digital arts or digital collectibles of some sort? And what is the next big thing for NFTs?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those and more questions were on the agenda for our first hackCast.

If you have missed it you can check it <strong><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/lets-talk-blockchain/lets-talk-blockchain-vladislav-dramaliev-part-1/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Part 2 we are going to discuss the need for crypto in the world; the need for regulations; decentralization, Eth2.0, and more just keep reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Why do you think the world needs crypto? Or why not?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The world definitely needs crypto! One of the reasons is the fact that it provides an alternative to the current financial and banking system. It&#8217;s very early to determine if this alternative is successful, but so far, is doing quite well. I think crypto is changing the way people think about money, and what money is, what value is, how value is created or destroyed, and who or what controls it. I think crypto and blockchain enable to create new financial products more suitable for a high-tech society. I am certain that with open blockchain infrastructure&nbsp; banking and financial services will be automated and will become more transparent and more trustworthy. I think in the 21st century, it&#8217;s important to look at the technology on how it can solve issues and not just stick to systems that have remained unchanged for hundreds of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With blockchain technology, smart contracts, automation, and artificial intelligence, the world of finance, banking, and insurance could change dramatically in the next years for the benefit of the users. These services can reach parts of the globe, which currently don&#8217;t have access to banking and financial services. Of course, a lot needs to be done on scalability and UI?UX before that. But that’s coming. For the developed world, I believe public, permissionless blockchain technology is the only viable deterretto the dystopian futures that could be created by states or corporations. Blockchain technology and crypto is leverage against these constantly increasing powers. Of course, crypto enthusiasts&nbsp; don&#8217;t have an army yet, so we need to rely on soft power. But soft power is becoming increasingly important in the 21st century. So when I think about blockchain and crypto &#8211;&nbsp; they&#8217;re not trying to destroy the existing financial and banking services, but want to push them towards greater transparency, and make them evolve in a way. So I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a war between the two but more of a synergy that we are going to witness in the future. Still, if things don’t go the way we want them in the traditional finance and banking space, we can always fall-back to public blockchain platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Do you think that crypto projects need stricter regulations? In the crypto space, we always talk about decentralization, but still, someone has to be responsible?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very complex and important issue. I think the transparency aspect is more important here because crypto is more easily trackable and identifiable. There are, of course, practices that enable people to completely or at least, to a large extent, conceal their identities. I think the crypto space is kind of self-regulating. But since the crypto market cap is growing to trillionsof dollars (that&#8217;s not a small amount, but in comparison to the rest of the financial and banking space it&#8217;s not large) regulators will become more interested in it. So regulations are coming. For the larger part of humanity, regulations will actually open the doors to crypto, the minority of cyberpunks, maximalists, idealists and people who are looking into crypto in a more philosophical way, will also get what they want in terms of decentralization and the whole spirit of the technology, but I think there will be a compromise made on both sides &#8211; between those who don&#8217;t want regulation and the ones that want full regulation. I believe we will meet somewhere in the middle. This will be a positive development, depending on what exactly these regulations look like. Some of the proposed regulations that I&#8217;ve seen sound impossible to implement in practice. It&#8217;s very interesting to see how far that will go. In the EU the regulation around  crypto and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/defi-decentralized-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">DeFi</a> will be formed by legislation but also some interesting European Court of Justice rulings. So regulation is inevitable, like it or not. It might change the user experience, but at the same time, it might bring a lot more users to the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Do you believe in true &#8220;decentralization&#8221; and to what extent do you think it can be achieved?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think everyone&#8217;s focusing on decentralization, and this is not the point here. I think trustlessness is more of a key point. The ability to be sure that certain applications cannot be stopped or affected by anyone that is out there, and are functioning as they are supposed to be, without anyone being able to stop them or modify them. Decentralization is actually not a natural state in our physical world when it comes to how systems work. A direct example here is the competitive advantages in economics, and production at scale &#8211;&nbsp; it&#8217;s much more efficient to create a factory that creates a specific product. So in terms of efficiency, it&#8217;s much more adequate to be centralized and many systems are pushing in this direction. So what we are actually trying to do here is fighting against natural laws in order to achieve robustness. But I don&#8217;t think that pure decentralization can be achieved. We can see that even in Bitcoin, which is one of the most decentralized blockchain networks. There are four pools that produce more than&nbsp; 75% of the entire network. They are composed of individual miners, yes, but there is still centralization. The economic incentives keeping the network running are more important than decentralization. I like the decentralization aspect because of the existence of copies of the blockchain, that&#8217;s what makes it valuable. But apart from that, I don&#8217;t think decentralization is what keeps it running. I think the strong economic (game-theoretical) incentives that Bitcoin established are what’s protecting the network. I am, however, a fan of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Proof of Work</a> and still believe it is the better <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Sybil attack mechanism</a> in comparison to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Proof of Stake</a>. PoW connects the blockchain with the real-world via the conversion of energy into crypto, while PoS relies only on questionable economic incentives. I don’t like losing that real-world connection, but that’s where most of the altcoin projects are heading. Let’s see how that will go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What do you think about Eth2.0 and what do you think makes it better than other platforms on the market?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>That is also a controversial topic. Everyone was looking forward to <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">ETH2.0</a>. It looks like it might be one of the best well-protected solutions because of the whole amount of Ether that is currently being staked in order to be mined. But, let&#8217;s see how it goes. It&#8217;s going to be the first major implementation &#8211; the proof of stake. I think it will be a process before we really make it robust and move away from the proof of work chain. What makes it good is just the fact that <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Ethereum</a> in general is a brand that is one of the best-known names in the technology world and is just second to Bitcoin. It has a huge amount of dev resources behind and it has institutional support and the Ethereum ecosystem is unlike any other solution out there. From a technological point of view, I really can&#8217;t say I haven&#8217;t looked into the details. And even if I have, I&#8217;m just a marketing guy, and I heavily rely on the opinions of other people. But keeping in mind how many years it has been working, and how many devs are actually working on it. I believe that it might be a success. I&#8217;m still not convinced that proof of stake is really the best technology out there and I also don&#8217;t think that Ethereum is currently the best technology out there. But it&#8217;s still the most popular so it enjoys the largest network effect. That is a guess again. The best technology does not always win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>It has recently been talked about the long-awaited Tapoot and Schnorr signatures in the Bitcoin space, do you think this is a step forward in favor of privacy and scalability for Bitcoin? What do you think about Bitcoin upgrades?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think those upgrades are very important and I am waiting for them impatiently, to be honest. They will make the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/running-full-bitcoin-node-over-tor-on-ubuntu/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Bitcoin network</a> more efficient without increasing the block size, and also make it more private. And this privacy is actually the part that I&#8217;m most interested in because I think Bitcoin requires more privacy. On the other hand, we have witnessed that some privacy coins were delisted by exchanges. So it&#8217;s interesting to see how that will work. What I think will happen is that some people will use the privacy-preserving features of the Bitcoin network, but exchanges and other big economic actors won&#8217;t. So in effect, the Bitcoin network will functionally be divided into a formal public and private-public network. . This will be the best way forward because if all transactions are private, large economic agents participating in the Bitcoin ecosystem will have a harder time serving users. But definitely, there should be some straightforward solution for privacy without resorting to mixer services. So all upgrades to the Bitcoin network are welcome. And of course, they need to be implemented very carefully, because we don&#8217;t want to lose any trust in the network. It&#8217;s very important to keep the Bitcoin network robust and well-secured.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What advice would you give to people who are just entering the Blockchain space, whether as users or developers?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, as users, I always give the advice to do some research and get some crypto. Even small amounts will push you further down the rabbit hole. You&#8217;ll start looking at charts more frequently, then you&#8217;ll be reading the news more frequently,&nbsp; at your position 24 times a day. Are you in profit? Are you at a loss? What are the reasons behind that and so on. That’s how you get hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for developers? Well, what can I say, it would be an interesting time for them. Because you know, <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/defi-decentralized-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">decentralized systems</a> are very different from centralized ones. The processes of developing, upgrading, and securing them are different. But definitely, I think this technology will be fundamental in the future. And I think blockchain will be in some form behind most of the banking and financial transactions after 5 to 10 years, unless something more efficient, or something more secure, manages to attract a large developer resource and liquidity. But again, as I said, it&#8217;s not always the best technology that wins, but the technology that most people are using. So join us in the blockchain space. It&#8217;s one of the most exciting spaces in 2021. It&#8217;s super-fast-paced. The scale and speed of innovation is just mind-boggling. And yeah, it&#8217;s never ever dull, so join the fun and get future-proofed.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In Part 1 of our interview with Vlad, we talked about Blockchain and DeFi projects, the current bull-run, and more.
