Why run Bitcoin node? Why Tor?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why Bitcoin full node?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A full node allows you to participate in the verification of all the transactions and blocks in the Bitcoin network and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/blockchain-software-development/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">blockchain</a>. Almost all of the full nodes participate in this validation process and relay the transactions and blocks to other nodes they &#8220;know&#8221; (are connected to).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running a full node helps Bitcoin&#8217;s peer-to-peer network grow and be more decentralized, so clients won&#8217;t have to rely on centralized services for querying the network or transmitting transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Many people and organizations volunteer to run full nodes using spare computing and bandwidth resourcesâ€”but more volunteers are needed to allow Bitcoin to continue to grow. This document describes how you can help and what helping will cost you. </p><cite>https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Following few steps you will be able to setup a bitcoin full node running on the Tor network (privacy matters).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why run on Tor?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin is said to be many things, amongst them anonymity is one of the features to stand out. It is not entirely true the transactions in the network are anonymous, rather pseudonymous, and while it is true that a transaction does not identify a user or wallet, there is a potential for privacy to be partially undermined, by methods that could identify the IP address of a transaction originator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you care about your digital privacy &#8211; keep reading. ðŸ¥·</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Tor</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software\">free and open-source software</a>&nbsp;for enabling&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity\">anonymous communication</a>&nbsp;by directing Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network\">overlay network</a>&nbsp;consisting of more than seven thousand relays<sup><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)#cite_note-torstatus-6\">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;in order to conceal a user&#8217;s location and usage from anyone conducting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_and_network_surveillance#Network_surveillance\">network surveillance</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis#In_computer_security\">traffic analysis</a>. Using Tor makes it more difficult to trace the Internet activity to the user: this includes &#8220;visits to Web sites, online posts, instant messages, and other communication forms&#8221;.<sup><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)#cite_note-nyt-navels-7\">[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;Tor&#8217;s intended use is to protect the personal privacy of its users, as well as their freedom and ability to conduct confidential communication by keeping their Internet activities unmonitored.</p><cite>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>01. Setup SSH</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are using a VPS or other cloud machine which you can access via SSH, or your machine already has SSH enabled you can skip this step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"http://ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a> 20.04 LTS Desktop and Server come without SSH service enabled by default, which we need to be able to access remotely our machine, but you can easily enable it by just one command.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This command will install <a href=\"http://www.openssh.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">OpenSSH</a>, which provides free SSH connectivity tools and supports all SSH protocol versions. OpenSSH encrypts all the traffic to eliminate possible eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: The default port for SSH is 22, but you can configure it to run on a port of your choice by editing the config file at <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, and apply the changes by restarting the service <code>sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have UFW firewall running on your machine, you will need to allow incoming SSH connections. Type the following command:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo ufw allow ssh</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After running it you should see the output below.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Output\nRules updated\nRules updated (v6)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: If you changed the default SSH port (22) to a custom port, you will need to open that port instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your ssh daemon listens on port&nbsp;<code>4242</code>, then you can use the following command to allow connections on that port:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo ufw allow 4242/tcp</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we are setup with the SSH configuration we can proceed to the real deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>02. Install packages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to install some packages needed for compilation of bitcoin&#8217;s source code.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo add-apt-repository universe</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible this is already added, so you might see something like <code>'universe' distribution component is already enabled for all sources.</code> If so &#8211; just ignore it and proceed further.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libtool pkg-config libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libevent-dev doxygen libzmqpp-dev libdb++-dev</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>03. Install BerkelyDB</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin Core is still using BerkleyDB 4.8.30 because of backward compatibility. Using a newer versions makes the wallet incompatible with older versions, making downgrade impossible (or at least difficult).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can do this manually by downloading it via `wget`.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>wget http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Then verifying the hash of the file:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>echo '12edc0df75bf9abd7f82f821795bcee50f42cb2e5f76a6a281b85732798364ef db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz' | sha256sum -c</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Extracting the archive:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>tar -xvf db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Configure and build the BerkleyDB for unix</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>cd db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>mkdir -p buildBDB_PREFIX=$(pwd)/build../dist/configure --disable-shared --enable-cxx --with-pic --prefix=$BDB_PREFIX</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>make install</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The above may fail with an error similar to this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>In file included from ../dist/../dbinc/mutex_int.h:12, from ../dist/../dbinc/mutex.h:15, from ./db_int.h:884, from ../dist/../cxx/cxx_db.cpp:11: ../dist/../dbinc/atomic.h:179:19: error: definition of â€˜int __atomic_compare_exchange(db_atomic_t*, atomic_value_t, atomic_value_t)â€™ ambiguates built-in declaration â€˜bool __atomic_compare_exchange(long unsigned int, volatile void*, void*, void*, int, int)â€™ 179 | static inline int __atomic_compare_exchange(</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If so you will need to apply some patches for C++11 which are required for the build. The developers at bitcoin have provided a nice shell script which does the downloading, verification and installation of those automatically here <code>https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/install_db4.sh</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can fetch and run it like so:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/master/contrib/install_db4.sh\nchmod +x install_db4.sh\n./install_db4.sh .</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After few minutes you should see a message including <code>db4 build complete.</code> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also see some more info about flags which you should use for compiling bitcoind (don&#8217;t worry if you did not copy those &#8211; you will find them below).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>04. Compile Bitcoin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to compile bitcoin, we first need to clone the source code repository from Github. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to checkout a version tag so we don&#8217;t run into problems, building from the <code>master</code> branch, as there the developers are constantly pushing new code.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>cd bitcoin\ngit checkout v0.21.0\ngit status</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After checking out the release tag and running the status check you should see this message:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>HEAD detached at v0.21.0\nnothing to commit, working tree clean</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time for us to build the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>./autogen.sh</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>export BDB_PREFIX='${BDB_PREFIX}'\n./configure BDB_LIBS=\"-L${BDB_PREFIX}/lib -ldb_cxx-4.8\" BDB_CFLAGS=\"-I${BDB_PREFIX}/include\"</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>make\nmake check\nsudo make install</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We now have successfully compiled bitcoin! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥ðŸŽ‰</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>05. Configure Bitcoin to use Tor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-38be3746-3589-4fa3-a065-8cd02e28d84d\">Before staring syncing the blockchain history we need to configure some settings for our bitcoin node.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"block-38be3746-3589-4fa3-a065-8cd02e28d84d\" class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>cd ~\nmkdir .bitcoin\ntouch .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf\necho \"txindex=1\" >> .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up <code>txindex=1</code> will make Bitcoin rescan the whole blockchain and rebuild the whole database. This can take several days depending on your hardware and internet connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Tor is properly setup in our system bitcoind will be able to communicate to other nodes over Tor network, otherwise it will default for communication over TCP. As we care about our privacy we want to explicitly forbid communication over TCP and allow it to only use Tor. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>echo \"onlynet=onion\" >> .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Setup a maximum number of inbound + outbound connections the node can use, so it does not drain your bandwidth.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>echo \"maxconnections=20\" >> .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As already mentioned the initial bitcoin blockchain download takes few days to weeks and using Tor will make this time longer as the Tor network is a bottleneck. One reason for that is due to low-bandwidth volunteer-operated Tor routers, but with wider adoption and volunteers running nodes this will change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing Tor on Ubuntu is pretty straightforward and easy:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt install tor</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After the installation is complete we need to check the configuration and ensure we have all of these configurations in <code>/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc</code></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>ControlPort 9051\nCookieAuthentication 1\nCookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To view the file we can use <code>less</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>less /usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In case any of those configuration settings is missing, use `echo` to add it to the file:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo sh -c \"echo 'ControlPort 9051' >> /usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc\"</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"block-38be3746-3589-4fa3-a065-8cd02e28d84d\" class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">If you did edit the file, make sure to restart the Tor service:</pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Next step is to allow <code>bitcoind</code> to access to Tor, by adding it to that user group. Replace <code>username</code> with the Ubuntu account username you are operating under.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor username</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally we can launch Bitcoin over Tor: ðŸ™ŒðŸ¥³</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bitcoind -daemon</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We can follow the logs and monitor progress of the node syncing using <code>tail</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>tail -f ~/.bitcoin/debug.log</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetching <code>getnetworkinfo</code> should result in IPv4 and IPv6 flags set to <code>false</code> and Tor to `true`. This will ensure us that we are operating our node privately.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, after the sync, we can use <code>bitcoin-cli</code> for querying information for the network status, connections and transaction and blocks information. Get peer info:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | grep true</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspect a raw transaction:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction 0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And inspect the raw output:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff0704ffff001d0104ffffffff0100f2052a0100000043410496b538e853519c726a2c91e61ec11600ae1390813a627c66fb8be7947be63c52da7589379515d4e0a604f8141781e62294721166bf621e73a82cbf2342c858eeac00000000</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-26b33e98-5d62-4b3f-901c-2970218ead0e\">References and resources</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/install_db4.shâ€¨\" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/install_db4.sh</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18846â€¨\" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18846</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/depends/packages/bdb.mk#L17â€¨\" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/depends/packages/bdb.mk#L17</a></li><li><a href=\"https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/79758/bitcoin-built-with-a-newer-berkeley-database-incompatible-with-a-older-walletâ€¨\" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/79758/bitcoin-built-with-a-newer-berkeley-database-incompatible-with-a-older-wallet</a></li><li><a href=\"https://8bitcoin.medium.com/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-full-node-over-tor-on-an-ubuntu-linux-virtual-machine-bdd7e9415a70â€¨\" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://8bitcoin.medium.com/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-full-node-over-tor-on-an-ubuntu-linux-virtual-machine-bdd7e9415a70</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch03.asciidocâ€¨\" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch03.asciidoc</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4y7nc3/create_bitcoin_full_node_with_tor_step_by_step/?st=j5n7z1q1&amp;sh=392084c9\" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4y7nc3/create_bitcoin_full_node_with_tor_step_by_step/?st=j5n7z1q1&amp;sh=392084c9</a></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>00.

This also involves a wide variety of technology stack options, depending on the desired outcome and use-case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purpose of this tutorial though, we will develop an app from scratch to a working decentralized application on aeternity blockchain with a simple frontend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let the timer start:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Initialize our project</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We will use the <a href=\"https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-aeproject-js\">aeproject</a> tool which will allow us to easily set up the development environment locally.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>dependencies<ul><li>docker</li><li>npm &amp; node</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Install globally</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>npm install -g aeproject</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Initialize project</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aeproject init</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Write our smart contract(s)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this step, we will develop a simple smart contract that is only storing an integer (number) in its state on the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s also add a getter method which will allow us to read from the contract state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, we will do something like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>@compiler >= 4\n\ncontract MyContract =\n   record state = { number: int }\n   entrypoint init() : state = { number = 0 }\n   stateful entrypoint set(x: int) = put(state{number = x})\n   stateful entrypoint get() : int = state.number</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In our case, we can further simplify our contract since we are only storing a single integer value. As we know Sophia contracts have restricted mutable state and it is a strongly typed language so we need to define it initially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, we can define our <code>state</code> to be of <code>type</code> <code>int</code> as we don&#8217;t need the whole <code>record</code> structure for this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>@compiler >= 4\n\ncontract MyContract =\n   type state = int\n   entrypoint init() : state = 0\n   stateful entrypoint set(x: int) = put(x)\n   stateful entrypoint get() : int = state</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the same contract, written in Solidity, on Ethereum blockchain just for comparison if you are more familiar with Solidity &#8230; or not:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>pragma solidity >=0.5.0 &lt;0.6.0; \n\ncontract MyContract {\n    uint256 number;\n    constructor() public {\n        number = 0;\n    }\n    function set(uint256 _number) public {\n        number = _number;\n    }\n    function get() public view returns (uint256) {\n        return number;    \n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Deploy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order for us to deploy to an actual <code>testnet</code> or <code>mainnet</code> we need to have some AE tokens on the selected network, so we can pay the mining fee for the transactions we will make to the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: We could also deploy it on a local testnet which can be started via <code>aeproject node</code></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3.1. Create a wallet</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If we do not yet have a wallet which will be used for deployment we need to generate ourselves one:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aecli account create &lt;WALLET_NAME></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Note: To quickly test all of Aeternity's blockchain features from your Terminal, you can Install and use our NodeJS CLI by running:\n\nnpm i -g @aeternity/aepp-cli\naecli --help</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>3.2. Fund the wallet</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We will get some testnet AE tokens from the <a href=\"https://faucet.testnet.aepps.com\">faucet</a>, so we can deploy the contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3.3. Get our private key</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to be deploying via the command-line interface (CLI), so we will need to have our private key to pass it to the deployer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get our private key:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aecli account address &lt;WALLET_NAME> --privateKey</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>3.4. Deploy to testnet</h4>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aeproject deploy -n testnet -s &lt;SECRET_KEY> --compiler https://latest.compiler.aepps.com</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Interaction with the contract</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are multiple we can interact with our contract. The first and most easier is to use one of the online IDEs available out there &#8211; contracts.aeternity.art, fireeditor etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>4.1. Online IDE.</h4>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>contracts.aeternity.art &#8211; we put our contract code in the editor and we can access our contract by adding the address in the <code>&lt;Address&gt;</code> field so we can interact with it.<br> <code>set</code> &#8211; for setting a new value in the smart contract we have to make a stateful call (which modifies the state and costs gas)<br><code>get</code> &#8211; our getter we can access by calling static function.<br></li><li>fireeditor.nikitafuchs.de &#8211; Same as above we can put our contract code and access the freshly deployed contract <strong>at address</strong>.<br></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h4>4.2. via the SDK</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We can access our contract instance via this simple command and start interacting with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><code>await sdk.getContractInstance(CONTRACT_SOURCE, { contractAddress: OUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS} );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course we will first have to set up our project and intialize the SDK there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Fully-fledged Decentralized app</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>5.1. Set up frontend</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to setup our simple fronted we will use the waellet boilerplate repo which is pre-configured to communicate with the waellet extension and has the aeternity javascript sdk already prepared there. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>git clone https://github.com/waellet/waellet-aepp-boilerplate &amp;&amp; cd\nnpm install</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>5.2. Add the contract interface (or the full contract code)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to add our contract interface in the app, so we can call the correct methods and encode the transactions properly. This is similar to the ABI in Solidity for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-1024x460.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1763\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-1024x460.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-300x135.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-768x345.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-1038x466.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25.png 1310w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>https://github.com/waellet/waellet-aepp-boilerplate/blob/23419a910f668069990f96b775bd119aba70f8d3/src/views/Home/Index.vue#L204-L216</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>5.3.

These protocols provide a strong probabilistic safety guarantee in the presence of Byzantine adversaries while their concurrent and leaderless nature enables them to achieve high throughput and scalability.  Unlike blockchains that rely on proof-of-work, they are quiescent and green. Unlike traditional consensus protocols where one or more nodes typically process linear bits in the number of total nodes per decision, no node processes more than logarithmic bits.  It does not require accurate knowledge of all participants and exposes new possible tradeoffs and improvements in safety and liveness for building consensus protocols. The paper describes the Snow protocol family, analyzes its guarantees, and describes how it can be used to construct the core of an internet-scale electronic payment system called Avalanche, which is evaluated in a large scale deployment.  Experiments demonstrate that the system can achieve high throughput  (3400tps), provide low confirmation latency (1.35  sec),  and scale well compared to existing systems that deliver similar functionality. For our implementation and setup, the bottleneck of the system is in transaction verification.</p><cite>https://avalabs.org/QmT1ry38PAmnhparPUmsUNHDEGHQusBLD6T5XJh4mUUn3v.pdf</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s even a really nice graphical demo here: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://avalabs.org/snow-bft-demo/#/snow\" target=\"_blank\">https://avalabs.org/snow-bft-demo/#/snow</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DappCon</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>DappCon focuses on decentralized applications, tooling, and foundational infrastructure on Ethereum. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This event is bringing together hundreds of blockchain and smart contracts developers, researchers and enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This years edition was a great place for anyone in interested in the ecosystem or networking with dapp developers to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>ETHBerlin hackathon</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We assume if youâ€™re reading this document, that you know what ETHBerlin Zwei is, but to recap: ETHBerlin Zwei is a combination of a hackathon, experiences, workshops and talks, happening from 21st till 25th of August 2019 in Berlin, Germany.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Although we did not participated hacking at the ETHBerlin hackathon, there were quite big amount of other clever people there, which didn&#8217;t stayed unnoticed (our friends from AirGap got to win one of the prizes). </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aeternity Meetup</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the peak of the 10+days long event &#8211; Blockchain Week Berlin aeternity invited developers to join and meet at the Blockchain Embassy and talk blockchain, with beers and pizzas!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1545\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Philipp Piwowarsky &amp; Milen Radkov presenting at Aeternity Meetup Berlin</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Philipp and Milen did an Introduction to <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/build-your-first-decentralized-application-aepp-on-aeternity-blockchain-sophia-smart-contract-address-book/\">Sophia Smart Contracts</a> on Ã¦ternity.

Its not a developers meetup without pizzas, chips, beers, and pickles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/blockchain_developers_meetup_12_3-e1565253129147-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Blockchain Developers Meetup 12\" class=\"wp-image-1508\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/blockchain_developers_meetup_12_3-e1565253129147-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/blockchain_developers_meetup_12_3-e1565253129147-225x300.jpg 225w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/blockchain_developers_meetup_12_3-e1565253129147-432x576.jpg 432w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Blockchain Developers Meetup 12</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>And last but not least, as promised at the event opening, I&#8217;m sharing a list of blockchain developers news and updates for the month:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blockchain Developers Digest</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"Ethereum\">Ethereum</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ethereum 4 years birthday &#8211; the anniversary of the genesis block</li><li>Client releases<ul><li>Geth v1.9.1</li><li>Ethereum on ARM: new NanoPC-T4 and Raspberry Pi images with new supported devices and Prysmatic Eth2 client and VIPnode support</li></ul></li><li>Developers related<ul><li>Solidityâ€™s SMTchecker now supports multi-transaction checks and unbounded loops</li><li>web3js stable release.
