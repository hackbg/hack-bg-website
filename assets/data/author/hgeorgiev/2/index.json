We have also covered <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/ico-or-sto-7-steps-to-success/\">the steps</a> that you need to follow to bring your idea to life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, we have discussed the benefits of using blockchain and  what is the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/the-future-of-blockchain/\">foreseeable future of blockchain</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this series of articles, we would like to focus more on specific uses cases of blockchain and the and most obvious one is the use of <em><strong>Blockchain in Finance</strong></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finance is the engine of our economies and businesses.  But to have access to the financial system as a business owner up until now one needed to have an intermediary in the process. Most of the times those are the banks as well as other services providers cutting on your profits or increasing the price for the end user of your products. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Be your own bank</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With blockchain, you are your own bank. You can create your own account and operate it the way you want.  As long as you manage to keep your private keys safe you are safe. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"943\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-991\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1.png 943w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1-300x138.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1-768x354.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://advisory.kpmg.us/content/dam/advisory/en/pdfs/blockchain-future-finance.pdf\">https://advisory.kpmg.us/content/dam/advisory/en/pdfs/blockchain-future-finance.pdf</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But what exactly are the benefits for business owners to be their own bank?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Full Control</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, you have full control and full access to your funds. 24/7 365 days a year. No need to wait days for a payment to settle. When your customers pay you in crypto (ETH/BTC) you will have your money within a few seconds/minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Save Money</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, if you use crypto payments to purchase your stock you can save a lot of money on bank transfers. And third, since crypto payments are all recorded to the blockchain, you can use the records when doing your accounting, thus again you will save time and money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Automate</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to payments and money transfers, the blockchain is allowing business owners to run businesses in automated ways using smart contracts. Smart contracts are a series of instructions, written in a programming language, working on the basis of the IF-THIS-THEN-THAT logic, allowing people to have trusted interactions with each other without the need of a third party or an escrow service.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"993\" height=\"543\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-996\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2.png 993w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-300x164.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-768x420.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 993px) 100vw, 993px\" /><figcaption>Source <a href=\"https://blockgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/infographics-02-1.jpg\">https://blockgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/infographics-02-1.jpg</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Be innovative and cost-efficient </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the underlying technology of blockchain, <strong><em>the immutability,</em></strong> we can guarantee that what we see is the &#8220;truth&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, we can speak of some other benefits of using blockchain in your business.

Thanks to all the people that came and our awesome guest <strong>Rali Ralev</strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://weidex.market\">WeiDex</a></strong> we had not only learned cool stuff about Tron but also have had a lot of fun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was by far the funniest and maybe most interactive meetup that we have ever had. I encourage you, future guest and speakers, to be more involved in the meetups, as they are not ours but yours 🙂 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to fill these community events with moments of sharing and learning but also make them cozy and fun. At the end of the day, we are all in the same boat, struggling with the same problems and fighting the same monsters 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let me tell you what have you missed beside the fun if you did not manage to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blockchain Developers News Digest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the first part we had our CEO <strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/milen_radkov\">Milen Radkov</a> </strong>made a quick tour of relevant developers news. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milen started with a last minute call to all teams to update their <a href=\"http://infura.io\">Infura</a> legacy keys before they die on the 27th of March. It turned out to be a useful warning as some devs have missed this incoming major update. Along with the legacy keys, Infura users will benefit after the update from new API Security section that could be found in the dashboard. Infura is also promising premium services coming up soon after the update. So stay tuned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we learned about <strong>Embark 4.0</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you unfamiliar with what Embark is :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Framework by Status</li><li>Out of beta and ready for developers</li><li>Including Cockpit – An intuitive Web Interface<ul><li><strong>Dashboard</strong> &#8211; provides an overview of all processes controlled by Embark (interact with Ethereum, IPFS, ENS, Whisper)</li><li><strong>Blockchain explorer</strong></li><li><strong>Iterative Deployer &#8211; </strong>enables selective deployment of smart contracts to any network</li><li><strong>Code editor &#8211; </strong>contracts even get redeployed as changes are saved</li></ul></li><li>Integrated debugger &#8211; easy way to debug contracts by displaying solidity source codes lines where a transaction failed</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> Milen shared with us the novelties in Truffle v5.0.9 including new multi-chain infrastructure that enables basic Quorum support and debugger improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did not miss to mention about the <strong>Ganache v2.0 &#8211; Chocolate Birthday Cake 🎂    </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>bringing in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>New features<ul><li><strong>Workspaces &#8211; </strong>save your development blockchains in workspaces</li><li><strong>Contract State Decoding</strong></li><li><strong>Event Decoding &#8211; </strong>events that have fired during this chain&#8217;s life</li></ul></li><li>New options<ul><li><strong>Hardfork-</strong> option to change the hardfork. Possible options are: Petersburg, Constantinople, and Byzantium.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Another worth mentioning news was the release of Peter Tsankov’s team of ChainSecuriy &#8211; Soltix. Soltix is a scalable framework for automated testing of Solidity compilers allowing us to test Solidity compiler and EVM automatically. How cool is this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly Milen spoke about the shutting down of Mist and the release of the alpha version of the Playground &#8211; for generalized state channels built with the Counterfactual framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we proceed with <g class=\"gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"8\" data-gr-id=\"8\">Rali&#8217;s</g> presentation we took time to announce our recent <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/events/hack-partners-with-wearedevelopers/\">partnership with WeAreDevelopers</a> world congress and to share with the community the perks we get from it.

The participants in the votes (the so-called &#8220;bakers&#8221;) had the possibility to chose between 2 proposals. Athens A and Athens B. But before we look into the process in details let&#8217;s first say few words about tezos for those of you who are unfamiliar with the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tezos is a distributed ledger built on blockchain that is designed to facilitate the building of <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contracts</a> while allowing for the evolution of the platform in an organic manner. The Tezos blockchain is meant to be self-evolving and capable of amending functions based on the community’s determination thanks to the protocol&#8217;s on-chain governance process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But how exactly does the on-chain governance works? Understanding the Tezos amendment process.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amendment process can be broken into four discrete periods: the Proposal Period, the Exploration or “Testing” Vote Period, the Testing Period, and the Promotion Vote Period.

But before we continue, let&#8217;s first recap what topics we have covered till now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the previous posts, we have viewed briefly what is blockchain (from an oversimplified nontechnical perspective) and how your business can profit from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first post, we have discussed the benefits of integrating blockchain to your business. If you have missed this one you can read it now to get familiar with the technological promises of the blockchain and to learn how it can help your business grow. What is blockchain? Is it suitable for your business needs? What problems it solves, and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\">how to boost your business with blockchain?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our second post from this series, we spoke about the ways to finance your business idea or existing business through ICO or STO. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are unfamiliar with the difference between ICO and STO you can view the previous article here, <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain-part-2/\">boost your business with blockchain</a>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim of this post is to help you define the steps you have to take to bring your idea to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming that you already understand what blockchain is and you can make difference between ICO and STO. You are now confident that blockchain can help you realize your idea and you have decided to make a coin offering.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The typical development of a project is having the following milestones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Putting the idea into a business plan</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YgQytt2o4W0kCQa6\" alt=\"business plan\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@nikarthur?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nik MacMillan</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Although some successful entrepreneurs claim that they managed to develop their business without a business plan, in most cases, you will need one. The business plan will give you directions and will help you to visualize all details related to making your idea a successful business. It will help you organize yourself,  define your revenue streams, your competitors and your weaknesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Writing a White Paper</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“A white paper is an informational document, issued by a company or not-for-profit organization, to promote or highlight the features of a solution, product, or service. White papers are sales and marketing documents, used to entice or persuade potential customers to learn more about or purchase a particular product, service, technology or methodology. White papers are designed to be used as a marketing tool before a sale, and not as a user manual or other technical document developed to provide support to the user after making a purchase.” </em></p><cite>Investopedia &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/whitepaper.asp\">whitepaper</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Building a website to show your idea to the world</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*InoqV-4tFJnwMQJY\" alt=\"building website\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@halgatewood?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hal Gatewood</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say how important is your online presence. If your aim is a global market than you have to have a global presence. A company website is your first step towards it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Starting an international marketing campaign</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your campaign should be ready to launch ideally 2-3 months before the coin offering. If you don&#8217;t have a marketing guru <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">in</g> your team, I recommend you to hire a specialized agency. Besides a solid idea and a good team, a key factor to your success is your marketing action plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Building the token</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Q1aDk0gp1pEtXY5A\" alt=\"smart contact development\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jefflssantos?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jefferson Santos</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The step of building your digital asset /token/ actually consists of several others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you need to develop, secure and publish the crowdfunding smart contracts for your token sale event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second &#8211; something that will ease your future investors&#8217; experience and showcase your professionalism is an investor&#8217;s dashboard &#8211; a dedicated web-app where investors can easily contribute to your campaign. It is also the place where you will be conducting your KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) verifications in order for your project to fit the regulatory framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not a technical guy make sure that your project development is in good hands and you have everything ready prior to the launch of the coin offering. Small mistakes in your code can cost you millions, so leave time for an independent company to make a security audit to your smart contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Conducting the coin offering</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*PQmijCguucSiTT8t\" alt=\"launch your coin offering\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kydroon?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kurt Cotoaga</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A few things can happen that can disturb your token sale event. Hackers and fraudsters are constantly sniffing around the space and are figuring out some clever tricks. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>For example, one hacker changed the target Ethereum address during the  CoinDash token sale and stole $7 million worth of Ethereum overnight. </p><p>This sort of behavior is happening almost daily — hackers or con artists  pop up in Slack telling users that token sale sites have changed and pump-and-dumpers post fake claims on social networks to help move the  price. </p><cite>TechCrunch</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In this step is very important that you are in continuous communication with your community and potential <g class=\"gr_ gr_222 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"222\" data-gr-id=\"222\">investors,</g> so that they <g class=\"gr_ gr_228 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"228\" data-gr-id=\"228\">dont</g> get tricked and lose money.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Developing the product</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qlPODU42HKOsmkzw\" alt=\"tools\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@hnhmarketing?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hunter Haley</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After a successful campaign, the real work begins. Start allocating the funds and push the progress of the project. The project development itself should be divided into milestones including past achievements to give a clear picture of your progress to the investors. Your timeline should include what has been done, what are you doing now and what are you going to do in the next quarter, in the next years.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the 7 steps to be taken to lead the project to success. Their order should be respected and none of them can be neglected. Each step has its own budget and most of the times is conducted by a separate team/company. ex Marketing, Legal, Development etc. The most costly will be the marketing if the goal is a global reach. Second, depending on the nature of the cryptocurrency (if you choose a STO) could be the legal part which will depend not only on local jurisdiction but also on the jurisdiction of the investor&#8217;s country. The third will be the development of the cryptocurrency and all related builds around its launch (website, investor’s dashboard etc).</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great idea — but you are not a blockchain expert, Get in touch with us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full list of our services could be found on our website at <a href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://hack.bg/#services</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We<em> bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>How to determine and what are the milestones?

We came to the conclusion that the main benefit of using blockchain technology is to achieve <strong>trust.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qCfB1Rs_TejfX9bm\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mmckee30?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mitch Mckee</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the previous post, we concluded that trust is essential for making business and its the essence of blockchain tech, so using blockchain is beneficial for attracting new customers and partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we are going to discuss whether you should do an ICO or an STO to power your existing business or finance your new business idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ZktwoqxtvERrzPes\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rawpixel</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s first explain what is ICO and what is STO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ICO stands for <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/ico-initial-coin-offering/\">Initial Coin Offering</a> and as many of you had heard it was the main way for non-existing projects to gather an impressive amount of money during those last few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all started with Ethereum raising money to develop its platform, the one that has become the main platform to make ICO&#8217;s on. The peak was sometime in the middle of last year with projects like Tezos and FileCoin raising as much as 250 millions of dollars from individual investors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*li78tZhCpfoqOgA8\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@blankerwahnsinn?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fabian Blank</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though many of the projects failed to deliver the expected products, either due to lack of technology developments (the main issue being scalability) or by simply disappearing with bags full of money (a.k.a.

Questions regarding blockchain technology and how your business can benefit from it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of this post, you should be able to decide whether to integrate blockchain to your business or not, regardless if you are a successful business or in the idea stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>What is blockchain?</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5r4U6AAgFHb_rlYf\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@clintadair?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Clint Adair</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially blockchain is a distributed ledger, a peer to peer network, where every peer has all the information about the network and nobody can lie about the state of the network.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If somebody tries to cheat, the network is going to verify the information via its verification process ( consensus algorithm) and if the peers agree that the person is trying to cheat they will not include the information in the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to notice that nobody can change the previous records, one can only add new records to the chain. This is why we say that the blockchain is immutable and we can <strong>trust </strong>its records.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put it in a simple way, since we know that no one can cheat the network by saying I&#8217;m having zillions of dollars, the peers can trust each other. So <strong>trust </strong>is the first essential part of the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*sDXH7_MALP5UNkgC\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rawpixel</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part is <strong>transparency. </strong>Yes, you got me right, the blockchain is transparent. At early years many told that they can pay with Bitcoin and nobody will be able to track them down the road but nowadays we know that it is not a fact but an uninformed assumption.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*wUGptLcpvK72VqJ9\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@oliverschwendener?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Oliver Schwendener</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The third essential part is of blockchain technology is&nbsp;<strong>traceability.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since everything on the blockchain is linked, hence the block-chain, one can easily track things moving on the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*MeudmeZpOlYjTTtp\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@eberhardgross?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">eberhard grossgasteiger</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Just to wrap up the first important part of this article. The blockchain is a new type of accounting ( known as triple accounting ) and its main advantage over the previous type of accounting is <strong>Trust, Transparency, and Traceability.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>2.<strong> Ok, I got why blockchain is cool but is it a right fit for my company?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you answer with <em>yes</em> to the following question, then most likely your company can benefit from integrating blockchain technology into your business process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Is your company dealing with things that the customers/ partners need to </em><strong><em>trust </em></strong><em>you about?&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should your customers or partners trust you with their funds, the origin of the products you supply them with or simply the fact that you have the number of stocks that you are promising to ship by the end of the day?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your customers/ partners can trust you without even knowing you then they might decide more easily to do business with you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*OiIeloYdaRR-mMVI\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rawpixel</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>3. How can I boost my business with blockchain?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you have seen trust is essential in business and trust is an essential element of the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating blockchain to your business process is building trust, trust brings new customers and your business is growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beside integrating blockchain technology into your business, you can think of boosting your business with an ICO (initial coin offering) or an STO (security token offering).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/ico-initial-coin-offering/\">What is ICO</a> and what is STO you can learn in details in my next post.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great idea — but you not sure if blockchain technology can be integrated into your business, Get in touch with us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full list of our services could be found on our website at <a href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://hack.bg/#services</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong><em>bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Part 1 Many business owners are asking me, what can we do with blockchain?&nbsp; It is so because blockchain has become a buzzword that we hear from everywhere.

In this post, we will share with you the essence of yesterday’s meet-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The event went as follows.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>In the first&nbsp;part</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We covered crypto related news covering Forks, Security, and technology advancements, without going into many technical details. In the second part we have our fantastic speaker <a href=\"https://pmihaylov.com/\" data-href=\"https://pmihaylov.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Preslav Mihaylov</strong></a>, head of blockchain training at <a href=\"https://softuni.bg\" data-href=\"https://softuni.bg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Software University</a> (SoftUni Sofia), introduce the public to <strong>Solidity Assembly</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look more into the details&nbsp;…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our CEO <a href=\"https://medium.com/u/23eaffb29922\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/u/23eaffb29922\" data-anchor-type=\"2\" data-user-id=\"23eaffb29922\" data-action-value=\"23eaffb29922\" data-action=\"show-user-card\" data-action-type=\"hover\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Milen Radkov</a> went to meet with some cool guys at <a href=\"https://websummit.com\" data-href=\"https://websummit.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Web Summit</strong></a> in Lisbon, so this time our Business Development Manager Hristo led the party — it was about time someone else to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spoke about the recently released <strong>Cardano Rust Project,</strong> which is basically an API allowing third-party developers to dive into <a href=\"https://www.cardano.org/en/home/\" data-href=\"https://www.cardano.org/en/home/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cardano</a>. It is worth mentioning that the project is a toolkit compatible for iOS, Web, and Android.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we discussed the rise of the <strong>Bitcoin</strong> <strong>sidechains</strong> with the release of <a href=\"https://blockstream.com/liquid/\" data-href=\"https://blockstream.com/liquid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blockstream’s Liquid Network</a>. An alternative to the <strong>Lightning network </strong>but with focus on exchanges and the big financial institutions(worth having a look at).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did not miss to mention the unsuccessful release of Constantinople Hard Fork that did not manage to sync after launch with the Testnet. Few reasons were mentioned by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/5chdn\" data-href=\"https://twitter.com/5chdn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Afri Schoedon</a>, Parity dev and the takeaway is that the fork will be delayed until sometime in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we looked at a rather worrisome report saying that over 54% of the 100 top daily volume exchanges have security issues. And the most common issues are related to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Console errors</li><li>User Account Security</li><li>Registar and Domain Security</li><li>Web Protocol Security</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Next topic was the exiting release of Sapling, Zcash hard fork allowing shielded transfers to be completed with 100 times less memory (around 40mb) and probably six or more times faster. With this upgrade Zcash confidential transactions are getting mobile friendly because one does not need to run a full node anymore to run them. Zcash are bringing to us their awesome technology that will lead to us to the era of “privacy-by-default”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before the end of the news review, we mentioned the first Truckload Shipment Using Bitcoin Smart Contracts with Rootstock (RSK). During the shipment, the Funds for the transaction were held in escrow by the smart contract on the integrated RSK platform and were automatically released to the carrier upon delivery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly, we discussed a recent EOS report pointing out the EOS has misled the public on the number of transaction that it can handle. The study was funded by the Bounties Network which is led by Brent Xu of ConsenSys and for this purpose replicated the EOS network to analyze its performance during two months of testing. The conclusions it reached are fairly damning. They say, for example:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>— “EOS is not a blockchain, rather a distributed homogeneous database management system, a clear distinction in that their transactions are not cryptographically validated.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>— “The performance metrics observed when factors such as real-world network latency and packet loss are implemented indicate that TPS in EOS approaches levels comparable to Ethereum.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>— Various forms of consensus failure were shown in the network testing. Consensus is entirely dependent upon the voting mechanism which is based on social consensus, not algorithmic BFT consensus.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Getting more technical</h4>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a6980-12CAfLFUMbeGI-hVp3_cd0w.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Preslav Mihaylov</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into Assembly, Preslav gave to the audience an overview of Assembly Language and the Programming Language Types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed what are the advantages and the disadvantages of Compiled Languages over Interpreted Languages VM based Languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also looked at how they actually work:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ea65c-10AtGU2tDpnSaIwwClCkQgw.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>from assembly via Assembler directly to Machine&nbsp;code</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/9878f-1JfdOizhMyyJuRmXL-Yk_Dw.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Compiled Languages — Best Performance/ Lack of portability</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/33b93-1diwTxtzARUa00gyLjmzc8w.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Comfortable high-level features/ Worst Performance</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/668ba-1GKLDAUFVWXjyoE4U7xlV2A.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>a mix between compiled and interpreted languages</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discussed how the EVM is working and what are its benefits</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/a4a23-1KZIljUvcBOiH4fhCb8-HlA.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>platform independent</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Preslav explained the benefits of using Solidity Assembly, but also did not miss to explain the risks related to using it. Using Assembly to achieve features that are not yet introduced into Solidity can come to a high price if one messes up the opcode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Live Demo, we have been introduced to Basic Operations in Assembly aiming to boost developers confidence when they encounter Assembly at work.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ac280-1Ox5mVFGc1rkUEct4y-ypUw.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Basic operations in&nbsp;Assembly</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/76c77-1gqbWtp2FZIAu_wK7wPNbyA.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>using jump to implement for loop in&nbsp;Assembly</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>At the last part of Preslav&#8217;s presentation, we discussed the different types of memory in the EVM and their particularities.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Looking forward to meeting you on our next&nbsp;meetup.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you liked this article don&#8217;t hesitate to follow us on Medium.
