More precisely we spoke about use cases in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\">Finance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\">Supply Chain</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-healthcare/\">Healthcare</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-gaming/\">Gaming</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-insurance/\">Insurance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-real-estate/\">Real Estate</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> In this article, we would like to discuss the benefits that blockchain can bring to the <strong><em>distribution of digital content</em></strong>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why is blockchain good for the digital content distribution?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"346\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-1024x346.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1691\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-1024x346.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-300x101.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-768x259.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2-1038x351.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-2.png 1317w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>ownership, licensing, royalties</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> We can look at Blockchain as a distributed database or ledger, that can store in a <em><strong>transparent</strong></em> and <em><strong>immutable</strong></em> way records of all data exchanged between all parties in the ecosystem. In other words, this is a shared database where one can register <em><strong>ownership rights</strong></em>, <em><strong>licensing terms, and royalty rules</strong></em>, globally accessible and potentially validated by all parties depending on the type of consensus mechanisms in place. This could provide tamper-resistant evidence of ownership for the cataloging and store of original works, which would present great benefits in providing clarity to copyright authors, owners, and users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This means third parties would be able to use the blockchain to see the complete chain of ownership of a piece of work.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Records on the Blockchain can be used as a digital certificate of authenticity that will help third parties to identify authors of works. This tamper-resistant register of all sales, licenses,  and transfers of original works would help authors or artists to track when and who is using their work and to get more just royalty fees for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Transforming industry, trade and markets</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"943\" height=\"639\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1690\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1.png 943w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1-300x203.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1-768x520.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1-850x576.png 850w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px\" /><figcaption>digital media distribution</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to protecting the rights of the original creators of digital work, who may retain some rights after selling their content, blockchain technology could also protect consumer rights associated with digital products. This could apply to both mass-reproduced works equivalent to CDs and books as well as to the emerging field of unique digital artworks, which can be considered the digital equivalent of paintings. Consumers or buyers could also more easily verify the real owner of the content, the type of version, the set of rights attached to it, and agree to the terms set by the rights holders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations and entities involved in the music and media business, like record labels, publishers, performing rights societies, streaming services,<br> managers, artists, and start-ups could benefit from such a record to counter lost or misdirected rights revenues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain could be the technological basis to build a single online copyright and information portals for musical works where creators/artists will be able to automatically license and sell their work using smart contracts and associated cryptocurrencies. For example, a piece of music is inserted and published publicly in the ledger as belonging to the artist, and including licensing terms to enable consumers or buyers to compensate the artist according to the terms set out in smart contracts.  In the future, it could be possible for artists and consumers to have portable digital identities running on a blockchain but interoperable with streaming services like SoundCloud, YouTube, and other online music services.<br> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open ecosystems could reduce the entry barriers for new artists, simplify licensing and rights management, facilitate immediate payments to owners and creators, and enable new applications, products, and services with minimal friction and more balanced distribution or sharing of the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"298\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x298-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1788\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x298-1.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x298-1-300x87.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x298-1-768x224.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Smart Contracts</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The wide deployment of blockchain systems in creative industries could help prevent infringements or unauthorized use, and overall enable more efficient, cost-effective, and potentially fairer ways to compensate the owners and creators through pay-per-usage, micropayments or automatic payment distributions. Smart contracts could be useful in assisting in the sale and licensing. Transforming industry, trade, and markets by specific parties, such as writers, publishers or artists, check the use or streaming of this composition, then automatically execute how the revenue is divided by the copyright owner or owners, and eventually distributing the payments seamlessly.<br> <br>The combination of blockchain technology, IP, and smart contracts could also access content that can be lent to others for fixed periods before automatic return.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the current limitations?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an opportunity for organizations to leverage smart contract technology by integrating smart contract code and blockchain for the purpose of overseeing agreements and licensing. However, smart contract technology has yet to reach a mature stage where it can process a large number of transactions and update and revise contracts across a multiparty network (multi-chain interoperability). </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"779\" height=\"545\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1693\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4.png 779w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-300x210.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-768x537.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 779px) 100vw, 779px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Other challenges are related to current regulatory constraints and a need for wider recognition of blockchain. Possible regulatory constraints include questions regarding the issues of applicable laws and jurisdiction, the enforceability of smart IP rights (IP rights recorded in distributed ledgers), reliable rules and definitions for smart contracts, data security and privacy concerns. Yet various governmental agencies and IP registers,<br> for example, the European Union Intellectual Property Office is looking into the technology’s capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The general expectation around the use of blockchain is that it could support alternative business models for digital works according to the conditions set by their rights owners (either for free under certain conditions, or at a price), and ultimately change the dynamics between creators, authors, users, and distributors. This would imply defining and experimenting with new incentives to connect such a different set of stakeholders through greater transparency and data sharing.<br> </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, we can say that open and trusted access to data could create knowledge feedback loops between diverse stakeholders and foster groundbreaking data-driven applications running not only on the blockchain but deploying AI, machine learning, data analytics, and so on.  In the long run, multi-stakeholder inclusive innovation ecosystems could be running on a blockchain with no central authority, with multiple providers depending on the function needed, and with full interoperability between different services. This would be a modular approach for an open and transparent meta-system running with individual systems, not only adapted to the specific problems they are designed to solve but also fully interoperable with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would be accomplished by using open standards and accessible data running on blockchain systems, and in compliance with independent certification and/or regulatory frameworks within a multi-stakeholder model.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In a recent report entitled &#8220;Blockchain Now and Tomorrow&#8221; released by the EU (European Union) Science Hub, the authors are providing us with solid information based on their research about the potential use of blockchain and it&#8217;s socio-economic benefits.

His presentation started with a short evolution of money, from the exchange of goods, through the gold standard and paper money to the digital currencies. It is important to realize the chain of events that led us to the fiat currencies and the dependencies that we have created around money and on money printing organizations like FED, to realize the benefits of Decentralized Finance. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"762\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-1024x762.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1607\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-1024x762.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-300x223.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-768x571.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-774x576.jpg 774w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Tito Tiov &#8211; WeiDex</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into the details, Tito gave his best to explain to us what Decentralized Finance is, what are the use cases and what can we do on top of &#8220;Money Legos&#8221; as he called the existing DeFi platforms.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at them one by one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to the existing monetary system, where the money is printed by a government organization and the printed money is not backed by anything, since the removal of the gold standard, DeFi is based on digital assest and smart contracts build on top of blockchain protocols allowing fully transparent governance and creation of &#8220;money&#8221;, p2p lending and trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his presentation, Tito introduced us to some of the most advanced protocols build to power the growing market of DeFi dApps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, he spoke about the biggest and most famous app <a href=\"https://makerdao.com/en/\">Maker Dao</a>. Brading itself as &#8220;Transparent and sustainable finance&#8221;. Maker is comprised of a decentralized stablecoin, collateral loans, and community governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second to Maker by the number of users and revenue was Compound.  <a href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Compound </a>is an open-source, autonomous protocol built for developers, to unlock a universe of new financial applications. Interest and borrowing, for the open financial system.

And<a href=\"https://instadapp.io/\"> Insta dApp</a>,  Autonomous Banking Portal on Emerging Blockchain-based Financial Protocols.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the above-mentioned protocols and dApps could be used as building blocks of your future DeFi dApp, instantly and without need to pay additional fees.  One can easily start a new business only by building a fancier UI on top of Compound&#8217;s protocol as Tito mentioned in one of his examples of successful ways to use the existing infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"552\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1024x552.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1608\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1024x552.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-300x162.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-768x414.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1038x559.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image.png 1227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>money legos in practice</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As a CEO of WeiDex, Tito shared with us his company experience of using &#8220;money legos&#8221; in practice to boost the liquidity on their multi-chain decentralized exchange.

Despite the good weather and the summer vibes here in Sofia we gathered a decent amount of blockchain enthusiast, some old but also many new faces.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just before Rali&#8217;s talk, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/milenradkov/\">Milen</a> gave us a short update on the things he as done/seen on the recent <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/events/berlin-blockchain-week-2019-summarized/\">blockchain events in Berlin</a>.

The novelty is the way the consensus is done.  The nodes are randomly asking other nodes about their opinion, and building up their own confidence in their opinion vs other&#8217;s opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statebox is building a formally verified process language using robust mathematical principles to prevent errors, allow compositionality and ensure termination. In addition, the language is visual and allows one to inspect the flow of the program as it is executing.

His aim was to answer a bunch of important questions that we developers have to consider before getting started with the implementation of an actual solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_195604-e1567177287128-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1573\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_195604-e1567177287128-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_195604-e1567177287128-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_195604-e1567177287128-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Rali Ralev &#8211; WeiDex<br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin is the King of crypto. But is Bitcoin really suitable for accepting payments? What is the best way to do it? What are the challenges? Those are a few of the questions that Rali was answering during his presentation. For those of you who missed we are going to answer them one by one here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into more details, Rali sent some chills in the public by sharing his view that Bitcoin is just a Hipster&#8217;s tool for payments :). Some of the arguments where that currently Bitcoin has been mostly used for speculation and rarely to buy stuff. One of the reasons might be that most retailers are having bad rates when accepting Bitcoin. For example, a product purchased in BTC could cost 20% higher if purchased in USD. Another cornerstone of the problem could be the transaction time. Rali also claimed that there are probably more pictures of the famous &#8220;Accepting Bitcoin&#8221; sticker circulating on the Internet than actual transactions on the bitcoin network. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202129-e1567177470863-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1574\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202129-e1567177470863-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202129-e1567177470863-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202129-e1567177470863-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>blockchain developers meetup</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what has been said, Bitcoin is still used by some retailers to accept payments. Rali&#8217;s work experience led him to implement solutions in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first solution would be to use a third party service. According to Rali it is relatively easy to integrate a solution that is providing an easy way to convert BTC to your local currency. The convenience is that you don&#8217;t have to care about confirmation time and you don&#8217;t have to manage a wallet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawbacks are the high fees, the lack of control over your funds and the fact that you can be tracked. Additionally, if you are a service requiring multiple simultaneous transactions, you can easily hit the Gap limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This solution could be ideal for small businesses with low transaction volume and low technical teams willing to accept Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second solution discussed by Rali was the use of pre-generated addresses. The advantage is the user is keeping control over his public and private keys. However the use of many addresses can slow down the wallet&#8217;s operations. According to our speaker, this solution is ideal for fast prototyping and for exchanges.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202143-e1567177584386-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1575\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202143-e1567177584386-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202143-e1567177584386-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202143-e1567177584386-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>blockchain dev meetup Q|A</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The third and last option will be to generate addresses on-demand, notably the most recommended and scalable solution to use if you are tech-savvy.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To conclude his talk Rali have to the public his recommendation on wallets and resources, mentioning about Bitcoin core wallet, Electrum daemon and Mastering Bitcoin, the book of Andreas Antonopoulos.

If you are a novice to the concept of blockchain or you are still struggling to get into its core <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\">you can read about</a> in our previous articles where we speak about the technology in details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put it short, blockchain is all about <em><strong>trust, transparency, </strong></em>and <em><strong>traceability.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes blockchain so popular is the ability to be implemented in any kind of business having transactions (monetary or not), immutable record-keeping or programmable agreement (<a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contract</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p> In our previous posts, we have outlined specific business cases where we can apply the technology. Most in-demand arias are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\">Finance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\">Supply Chain</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-healthcare/\">Healthcare</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-gaming/\">Gaming</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-insurance/\">Insurance</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At this stage, we can stay that we are still developing the infrastructure to onboard more and more sectors and businesses. It is safe to assume that blockchain applications will be driving the world in the next 10-15 years, helping companies to <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\">reduce costs and increase efficiency</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Real Estate Market</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we are going to discuss the difficulties faced by the global real estate market and the potential of blockchain to help the market grow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Global real estate worth all sectors combined represents the whopping <em><strong>$217 trillion</strong></em>.&nbsp;Mostly dominated by the wealthy and large corporations. Through&nbsp;the blockchain, more people will be able to access the market where transactions can now be made more transparent, secure, and equitable.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"729\" height=\"243\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1524\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image.png 729w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-300x100.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2> Real Estate Problems / Solutions</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Platforms and Marketplaces</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the property listing is done on multiple platforms, resulting in time-consuming and costly operations when one is in a search for the ideal industrial or private property. There are also issues with data accuracy because the listings are done depending on broker preferences. This lack of standardization is further complicating the search process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Decentralized</em></strong> property record will enable fast and efficient property discovery.  A blockchain-based system would enable data to be distributed across a peer-to-peer network in a manner that allows brokers to have more control over their data, along with increased trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Title records</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Title records are another challenging-to-access  aspect of the real estate buying/selling process. Even at the age of the Internet, title  information remains stored at the local level and is offline. Blockchain can offer a new and more efficient way to to deal with this problem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Blockchain</em></strong> could provide a central title database to securely store and instantly access historical title records, allowing for the streamlining of title transfer in a property sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Financial transaction</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying, selling or renting a property has a cost. There are professional fees and commissions, inspections costs, registration fees, loan fees, and taxes associated with real estate. These costs even vary depending on the jurisdiction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Payments and transaction done via banks and other intermediaries are slow and expensive. Especially when we are dealing with cross-border transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Commercial Real Estate cash flow management</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In commercial real estate, there are various actors involved in the renting/buying/ selling process. Vendors, landlords, tenants, and property managers all performing multiple transactions checks and verifications resulting in more complicated accounting. This is making the process not only slower but also costlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"744\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1527\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3.png 744w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3-300x249.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3-693x576.png 693w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">Smart contracts</a> enable easier, transparent, and efficient property management and cash flow management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Executing a real estate lease using<strong><em> smart contracts</em></strong> can address many of the challenges associated with property and cash flow management. The traditional lease contract can morph into a smart tenancy contract.The contract could use rent or bonds for automated payments to real estate owners, property managers, and other stakeholders along with near real-time reconciliation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blockchain transactions </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"747\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1525\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1.png 747w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1-300x175.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is allowing for fast, secure and cheap cross-border transactions. Besides improving the speed and price of transactions blockchain distributed immutable ledger could improve the accounting accuracy and ease the efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3> Liquidity&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>There are hundreds of billions of dollars of commercial real-estate loans that need to be refinanced in the next three to seven years, but there are fewer lenders who will be able to provide that capital.  Properties in smaller markets, those with substantial vacancies and properties with weak borrowers already are experiencing a shortage in the capital.  </p><cite><a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-top-10-threats-facing-real-estate-2012-07-17\">source</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong><em>Blockchain and digital currencies</em></strong> are providing an innovative way to invest and to transact. Besides facilitating transactions, blockchain can allow for real estate to become more liquid. Property tokenization might be the next big thing for the sector allowing fractional ownership. A seller doesn’t have to wait for a buyer who can afford the whole property in order to get some value out of their property. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally blockchain also lowers the barriers to real estate investing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Blockchain technology can improve the real estate ecosystem by enabling  all involved parties to securely and efficiently share data and money. It  makes information more accessible, cuts out middlemen and reduces the  risk of fraud and theft. A more secure, speedier, trusted process for buying and selling and property that is beneficial for everyone. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>You have a project in mind?

But how exactly blockchain can help the Insurance industry, let&#8217;s find out!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Insurance Industry- key numbers and facts</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"324\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/b2ap3_medium_insurance-terms.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1457\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/b2ap3_medium_insurance-terms.jpg 640w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/b2ap3_medium_insurance-terms-300x152.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /><figcaption>Insurance industry</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The global insurance industry outlook is pretty positive, despite some major natural disasters that have impacted insurers profits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, global insurance income (volume of gross premiums written by  insurers) for property-casualty (p&amp;c) and life (without health)  reached EUR3655 billion or 5.4% of global output.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Sustained economic growth, rising interest rates, and higher investment income are among the positive factors that appear to be bolstering insurer results in 2018, setting the stage for enhanced top- and bottom-line growth in the year ahead.</em> </p><cite><a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/financial-services/us-fsi-dcfs-2019-insurance-industry-outlook.pdf\">Deloitte</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the positive results for 2018 and the positive expectation for 2019 many agree that insurers have to find ways to optimize and boost their profits in regard to a potential 2020 economic slowdown or another major economic crisis. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What could be done?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"791\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Global_Insurance_Brokerage_Market_2018-2022-1-1024x791.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1458\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Global_Insurance_Brokerage_Market_2018-2022-1-1024x791.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Global_Insurance_Brokerage_Market_2018-2022-1-300x232.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Global_Insurance_Brokerage_Market_2018-2022-1-768x593.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Global_Insurance_Brokerage_Market_2018-2022-1-745x576.jpg 745w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Global_Insurance_Brokerage_Market_2018-2022-1.jpg 1056w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping in mind the key trends, when we speak of mass-scale solutions,  we should think of technological solutions that are allowing businesses to scale, to cut expenditures and thus allowing them to grow their profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>While generational change is still buffeting the insurance industry, many insurers are becoming more comfortable with new technologies and changing from product-focused to customer-centric organizations. They are increasingly open to forming partnerships with InsurTechs and using technology. </em></p><cite><a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/insurance/library/top-issues.html\">PwC</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The most promising solutions that have been explored to make the insurance companies more cost-effective, thus more profitable, are Cloud computing and Blockchain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While cloud computing has started to affirm its importance in the space, we are yet to witness how blockchain is going to transform the insurance industry. One thing that we can notice is the exploration of how companies can collaborate with competitors. This results in the creation of consortiums expected to launch blockchain initiatives that are going to impact the space in the near future. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are the current problems?</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Intermediaries</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The insurance industry is built around intermediaries (agents and brokers) and companies are heavily relying on their performance to satisfy customer&#8217;s growing expectations.  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>When customers interact with an insurer, their benchmark isn’t one carrier versus another, it’s their experience with online retailers and service providers (e.g., video streaming). This has resulted in customers expecting a much faster, transparent, and more intuitive experience than they’ve ever had before. </em></p><cite><a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/insurance/assets/pwc-2019-insurance-issues-compilation-report.pdf\">PwC</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>Paperwork </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another noticeable problem is that there’s still too much manual work, inefficiencies in distribution, and inconsistent levels of customer service that are punishing both customers and companies. Customers are suffering because of the quality of the service that they get and the companies because of the missed opportunities and profits.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Data quality  </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance companies are relying heavily on data. Third-party data is often inaccurate and expensive. Companies are spending time to analyze it and integrate it into their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digitizing the business will allow companies to generate their own data, thus know and serve their customers better. In this regard, with future development of blockchain and when people start having digital identities, it will be easier to identify a user&#8217;s profile (understand his needs), without revealing his identity to the provider. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are the solutions?</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Blockchain can cut the intermediaries</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain digital nature is allowing insurance companies to create digital products, that the users can subscribe to online, without a need of an intermediary. The current heavy re-alliance on intermediaries does not only increase the cost of operation but can also lead to poor customer experience, witch than can affect the brand and hurt the revenues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second-generation blockchain networks allowing us to <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">create smart contracts</a> are the perfect fit for organizations willing to create <strong><em>transparent </em></strong>and <strong><em>automated </em></strong>solutions to serve the needs of their online customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"539\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2-1024x539.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1460\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2-1024x539.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2-300x158.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2-768x404.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2-1038x547.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2.png 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">Smart Contract Life Cycle</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>Reduce the paperwork</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another benefit of using digital products is the reduced amount of needed paperwork.  Everything in a blockchain is handled electronically and in near real-time, so time spent on paperwork is decreased, thus saving man-hours to handle the manual paperwork processes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Improve the quality of the data</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Data is the new gold. Companies are trying to understand more about their customer&#8217;s behaviour and need to be able to propose tailor-made solutions but also to analyse and comprehend the industry&#8217;s trends and competitor&#8217;s market presence. Blockchain&#8217;s transparency and immutable nature are perfect features enabling insurance companies to record, store and analyse the data, that is coming from the interaction of the customers with their products. One can also trust this data because we know that it is real, not manipulated data. This, in turn, can help companies make better predictions and design better risk models, allowing them to minimize risk and maximize their profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Reduce Transactions time and cost </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the above-mentioned solutions that can help insurance companies improve their profits and processes, companies can use blockchain to pay customer claims.  The process can be near-instant, with a heavy reduction of cost per transaction. This will not only help cut transaction fees but also will improve the company relationship with its customers. Speeding up the repayment process can lead to increased trust and customer satisfaction.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the financial sector, the general view in the industry towards the adoption of blockchain technology is &#8220;wait and see&#8221;. The reason could be that companies are feeling satisfied with the recent years achievements as their market and profits grew in size. However, it is worth mentioning that, blockchain early adoption can lead companies to a competitive advantage over their competitors allowing them to stay in the front-line of the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not being a panacea,  we believe that blockchain technology can offer a significant improvement on processes like transaction handling, improvement of data quality, paperwork reduction and reduction of intermediaries giving early adopters clear advantage over their competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need more information, get in touch with us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\">hello@hack.bg</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team is here to help you from architecture design to a perfectly working solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the full list of our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>We bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>We have discussed widely in our previous articles the fundamentals of Blockchain.

In this article, we are going to explore the benefits of blockchain technology in the gaming industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gaming in numbers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As per recent reports, the gaming market currently represents the largest segment of the global digital content industry (bigger than movie and music industries combined), generating billions of dollars in revenues annually and attracting an extremely wide audience. Gaming is also considered to be one of the business areas in which blockchain technology is being implemented most rapidly.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"782\" height=\"697\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report.png\" alt=\"2018 Global Game Market - Per device &amp; segment with year-on-year growth rates\" class=\"wp-image-1346\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report.png 782w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report-300x267.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report-768x685.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report-646x576.png 646w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px\" /><figcaption>Infographics: © hack | Data: Global Game Market Report from newzoo</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a Newzoo report, global gaming revenues for 2018 were around $134.9 billion, 10.9% more than for 2017. Just to put it in perspective, digital distribution channels (marketplaces) account for most of these revenues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that mobile games are a primer and act as the key growth driver in the gaming industry, with a projected growth rate of 12.8% for 2018, taking that segment to $63.2 billion. At the same time, the forecast for overall retail sales of games is only $12.4 billion, or 9% of the whole industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blockchain application in Gaming Industry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p> The intersection of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and gaming is presenting real growth potential for both blockchain and gaming.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-1024x388.png\" alt=\"Blockchain application in Games\" class=\"wp-image-1351\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-1024x388.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-300x114.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-768x291.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-1038x394.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Blockchain application in Games</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Background</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The game that marks the beginning of the blockchain gaming is <a href=\"https://huntercoin.org/\">HunterCoin</a>.  Released in February 2014 as a live experimental test to see how blockchain technology could handle full on game worlds. The purpose of the game was to collect HUC coins, human mining, but due to its fame, when the number of players grew the blockchain started to experience processing and speed issues.  This is mainly due to the fact that the game was running on a bitcoin fork (not suitable for applications that need to scale). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017 was released one of the most famous blockchain games build on Ethereum, CryptoKitties. In short, it is a game of digital collectibles allowing the player to collect (buy), breed and sell different (unique) types of virtual cats.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"620\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto-kitties.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1360\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto-kitties.jpg 620w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto-kitties-300x165.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /><figcaption>Crypto Kitties</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Marketplaces</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Games and game items are available at marketplaces. Currently, there are both types of marketplaces, centralized and decentralized. What are the limitation and the advantages of using any of those?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The context</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The world’s largest centralized marketplace for virtual goods (OPSkins), is having millions of users, billions of items listed, and trading volumes estimated to be over $46 billion. The platform job is to maintain the transactional trust between the users and to prevent fraud by maintaining huge personnel to ensure the smooth running of the platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how good the service of a centralized platform (marketplace) is, centralized platforms are limiting users on the way the platform can be used and on the way they transact with each other. Settlements cost them high fees and the transfers are taking a long time to execute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a decentralized marketplace, problems like fraud, transactional settlement, and international payments transactions are handled via smart contract ensuring cheap, fast, secure and transparent service.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the other hand, decentralized platforms can use smart contracts to allows the facilitation and enforcement of a virtual asset transaction that guarantees the fulfillment of an operation (buy/sell) without requiring the interference of a centralized party, ensuring the correctness of the transaction (regardless whether it is an item or a monetary value).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies-1024x576.png\" alt=\"CryptoZombies - blockchain based game\" class=\"wp-image-1354\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies.png 1031w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>CryptoZombies &#8211; blockchain based game</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Asset transfers</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"5d3b\">Multiplayer Games Have LOTS of&nbsp;Items</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Runescape has 35,000 and World of Warcraft, the king of MMOs has over 100,000 different items! Shooters like Overwatch and Team Fortress 2 each have thousands of skins and items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tokenization</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most exciting aspect of decentralized virtual goods exchanges is the ability to tokenize virtual goods. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we can see in the above example there are thousands of game items that can be tokenized and traded. But when a player dedicates of his time and money to play a game (develop a hero) he is left with nothing when he deletes the game as all of the information about his game was stored on the company&#8217;s servers.  Now with blockchain, the player can not only claim and keep his virtual assets but he can also transfer/sell it to other players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of  game assets hosted on the blockchain is that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> Transactions and their history is easy to track (transparency)</li><li>No one can steal your asset, as long as you keep your privet key secure </li><li>Assets can be traded without the need for intermediary service</li><li>Assets can be easily transferred from one gamer to another. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Better security, as well as new opportunities and incentives for gamers, are just some of the benefits that blockchain can bring to our virtual pastimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a 50+ billion virtual goods market, we believe that this is extra motivation for players to claim control and ownership of their virtual goods. This could result in motivation increase, hence more user engagement and more revenues for the game development companies.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>In game purchases</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another evident application of blockchain in games is the integration of cryptocurrencies that can be used for in-game purchases. Global in-game spending is expected to reach 32 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, up from 22 billion U.S. dollars in 2015.                         </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this sense, cryptocurrencies can be used as a link between the internal economy of the game and that of the real world. They can be transferred and traded for other cryptocurrencies or fiat money via build-in decentralized exchanges or even centralized party exchanges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, using blockchain in game development can help create more unique objects and artifacts making them more valuable and more desirable. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Building trust</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past couple of years, games have begun to use blockchain features such as wallets and tokens to secure ownership of game artifacts. Blockchain can also ensure the authenticity of an asset with its inbuild trust and transparency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the other hand, players looking to buy a virtual item can be sure about its authenticity because the items are recorded on the blockchain, further developing trust between buyers and sellers and thus stimulating more transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, we can say that blockchain-based, open-source, decentralized systems will make the gaming experience more secure and transparent, guaranteeing fair conditions for all members. The decentralized gaming platform is bringing in technologies that will ensure user satisfaction, add value to virtual assets, and probably expand the size of the virtual gaming market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great idea — but you don’t have the skill to build it – get in touch with us at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the full list of our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>We bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In previous articles, we have discussed the fundamentals of blockchain technology.

Our goal is to build the next generation of browser extension wallets.  We have been working on the wallet for a few months already and we are grateful for the support of <a href=\"https://aeternity-ventures.com/\">aeternity ventures</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aeternity-foundation.org/\">aeternity foundation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/waellet/nnkfipoloblhgnahnaocfkhmmplcdneb\">waellet extension</a> is available in the Chrome Web Extension store.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What problem do we solve?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the team behind MetaMask has launched in July 2016, their browser extension managed to change the perception of the users as to how a cryptocurrency wallet should be. They made a &#8220;hot wallet&#8221; allowing you to use Ethereum based dApps directly in your browser. In addition one can store, send and receive ether and ERC-20 tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as the ecosystem is growing and we have more and more chains coming into the blockchain world, we feel that from a user&#8217;s perspective it is limiting to have access to only one network at a time. It is similar to having a bank card that is allowing you to pay for services in only one currency.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>We want to bring in the next step in the evolution of the browser extension wallets.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is our solution?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before wallets were mostly desktop applications making it very hard, user-unfriendly and unsafe to interact with the blockchain. This problem has been solved with the integration of the wallet into the browser /the browser extension wallet/.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using the existing technology as a stepping stone we started to envision a wallet that will bring even better user experience. Gone will be the times when the user will have to switch wallets so he can interact with dApps hosted on different blockchains.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does Waellet work? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We see Waellet as user&#8217;s first choice wallet when it comes to interacting with dApps hosted on different blockchains. Build around aeternity, Waellet is to become a tool that enables users to pay for different services without the need to worry about the network of the particular dApp &#8211; this will happen in a decentralized and cryptographic secure way through integration with the WeiDex &#8211; decentralized exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Waellet is still in beta and under heavy development.

Additionally, it is immutable and transparent. In some of our previous articles, we have looked in details into the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\">tech behind and the idea of blockchain</a>. Following the series of blockchain&#8217;s best use cases and disrupting industries with blockchain technology in this next article, we are going to explore how the healthcare sector can benefit from integrating blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Healthcare in numbers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthcare is a complex ecosystem composed of <em>Drug manufacturers</em>, <em>Medical equipment makers, Managed healthcare companies</em> providing health insurance policies and <em>Healthcare facility firms</em> operating hospitals, clinics, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Global spendings in healthcare all sectors combined:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2015 Global healthcare spending topping $7 trillion dollars</li><li>Expected to grow to over $8.734 trillion by 2020 and to over $10 trillion by 2025 </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> According to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bisresearch.com/industry-report/global-blockchain-in-healthcare-market-2025.html\">report by BIS research.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> &#8220;A global blockchain in the healthcare market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 63.85% from 2018 to 2025, to reach a value of $5.61 billion by 2025. The use of blockchain for healthcare data exchange will contribute the largest market share throughout the forecast period, reaching a value of $1.89 billion by 2025, owing to the use of blockchain to solve the most widespread problem in healthcare information systems related to interoperability and non-standardization that has created data silos in the industry.<em>”</em> </p><cite>* CAGR ( Compound Annual Growth Rate)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the current problems in the Healthcare sector?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4>Non-startartisation</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Data is the next big thing that is going to revolutionize public healthcare and more specifically how the data is recorded, stored, analyzed and shared. But the current systems, if existing, are inefficient because they are centralized (all information kept in one place), siloed and disjointed. Moreover, they are inefficient because they are not allowing for easy sharing of patients data outside of the host institution without exposing the data at a security risk. In addition, health data is hard to make sense of as it&#8217;s often times presented in different formats, according to industry experts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"mce_47\">Interoperability</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another problem putting patients health at risk caused by healthcare systems is the <em><strong>interoperability</strong></em> issue:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <strong>“Statistics show that up to one in five patient records are not accurately matched even within the same health care system. As many as half of the patient records are mismatched when data is transferred between healthcare systems.”</strong><br></p><cite> <br>Director of Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI), Shaun Grannis </cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>Data ownership and control</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Today patients information is not in their control.  This might have been accepted up until now but in the future patients might claim their right to have access to their personal information and to control it. At the current setting, their information is gathered and managed by their host institution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> Drug traceability</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Drug counterfeiting is a major problem in the pharmaceutical industry. According to the Health Research Funding Organisation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>10% to 30% of the drugs sold in developing countries are counterfeit</li><li>The counterfeit drug market is worth $200 billion annually</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> From a more economic perspective, drug counterfeiting represents an annual loss of 10,2 billion euros (11,23 billion USD) for the European pharmaceutical sector and 37.700 jobs are lost because manufacturers employ fewer people than they would if fake drugs didn’t exist. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How blockchain can solve those problems?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is still a developing technology but we can already see the huge impact that it has in various sectors and industries like <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\">Finance </a>and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\">Supply Chain</a>. Healthcare is just another example where we can see its implication:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <strong>The</strong>&nbsp;<strong>adoption of the blockchain technology could save the healthcare industry up to $100-$150 billion per year by 2025</strong>&nbsp;in data breach-related costs, IT costs, operations costs, support function costs and personnel costs, and through a reduction in frauds and counterfeit products. </p><cite>BIS report</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>According to pharma executives technologies are the one that are going to have the biggest impact on the industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"554\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-1024x554.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1211\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-1024x554.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-300x162.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-768x415.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-1038x562.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech.png 1244w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In its core blockchain is <strong>immutable</strong>, <strong>search-ready</strong> (big data and analytics), <strong>cryptographically protected</strong> (cybersecurity) and <strong>distributed system</strong> (cloud-like service). This is why blockchain is the perfect all-in-one solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new generation of blockchains is solving the<strong> standardization and interoperability </strong>issues by design. Allowing, via a specific protocol the communication between multiple blockchains. <em>This in the future will be crucial when dealing with different blockchain enabled solution for the healthcare industry.</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, blockchain also addresses the notion of <strong><em>data ownership and control</em></strong>. With the help of a smart contract (programable agreement), the patient can manage his data ( identifiable and non-identifiable) and share whatever he likes to share with whomever he likes to share it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recently written article, we have discussed the potential<a href=\"http://Blockchain can eliminate those risks by allowing end users to track each item origin with the help of IoT sensors.\"> </a><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\">use of blockchain in Supply Chain</a> and addressed the issue of <strong><em>drug traceability.</em> </strong>In short, we are reducing the possibility to buy a counterfeit drug by tracking the item with the help of IoT sensors and blockchain from the producer&#8217;s factory to our door. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the above mentioned problems, blockchain can also help the healthcare with payments and help to speed the verification of patient&#8217;s healthcare plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;<strong>Blockchain will become the next big healthcare technology innovation,</strong> particularly as it relates to payments and payer contracts. For example, in a situation when a health plan and patient are dealing with a contract, the blockchain can automatically verify and authorize information and the contractual processes. <strong>With transparency and automation, greater efficiencies will lead to lower administration costs, faster claims and less money wasted.&#8221; </strong></p><cite> <br>Bruce Broussard, president and CEO of Humana <br></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the payment process is automated in a <strong><em>trusted, transparent and verifiable</em></strong> way we will notice improvement of the whole process by reducing claim times and lowering administration costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having all information on a single platform is going to allow for deep analysis of population health and trends. Thus helping all parties to make more accurate planning and strategies, allowing them to deliver better, faster and more cost efficient services to the patients. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the next article about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hack.bg/category/blog/blockchain-and-business/\">Blockchain and Business</a>&nbsp;directly in your inbox subscribe to our newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great idea — but you don’t have the skill to build it – get in touch with us at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the full list of our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>We bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain&#8217;s Best Use Cases What is blockchain?

We do business with companies and people who we don&#8217;t know.  We have to rely on 3rd party auditors and assessors to make sure that the products, materials or ingredients we are buying are really what they are supposed to be. This is a very expensive process which is done normally in a non-digitalised way.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the other hand, small companies are having a hard time to get into the market due to the lack of trust.  <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the above-mentioned problems( global scale, trust, and transparency), we are able to identify other key problems like <strong><em>ineffective </em></strong><em><strong>risk management, lack of end-to-end visibility and obsolescence of technologies</strong></em>. All impacting negatively companies ROI. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Risk management</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the supply chain management tool is not having access to key data from the value chain the companies fail to make accurate risk predictions that lead to higher risk exposures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lack of end-to-end visibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>End-to-end visibility is key to ROI (return on investment). The inadequate supply chain visibility is leading to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Increased inventory costs resulting from inventory build-ups</li><li>Increased freight costs from premium shipping </li><li>Decreased productivity resulting from manually intensive processes</li><li>Poor customer experience</li><li>Loss of revenue from product shortages</li><li>Delayed cash flow</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Obsolescence of technologies</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using old, inefficient and closed (centralized) technologies is damaging companies <em><strong>ROI</strong></em>, partners <em><strong>trust </strong></em>and customers <em><strong>satisfaction</strong></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that there is a solution to all those problems and it is called blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> Blockchain has the potential to become the universal supply chain operating system – increasing security, improving transparency and creating scalability. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why is blockchain perfect solution to tackle the existing problems of the Supply Chain?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In another series, we have already discussed <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\">what is blockchain</a> and how you can use the technology behind Bitcoin and Ethereum to help your business grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, blockchain is a digital ledger technology used to record transactions in chronological order. One can only add new transactions (not remove or edit), thus the ledger is immutable. Its underlying technology is offering us<em><strong> trust, transparency, and traceability</strong></em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we are going to look into its direct implementation in Supply Chain and learn why it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <em>Today’s supply chains are inherently complex- many lacking transparency due to lack of interoperability and inconsistent or unavailable data – areas where blockchain can counter these inefficiencies and add new value.</em><br></p><cite> <br><a href=\"https://www.blockchain-supplychain.com/\">https://www.blockchain-supplychain.com/</a> </cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The supply chain holds tremendous interest in the blockchain. The technology will be most useful in areas such as <em><strong>supplier payments, product traceability, and contract bids and execution</strong></em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us look at them one by one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Supplier Payments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The area where blockchain is mostly used as of today is the area of <strong>secure, fast and transparent</strong> transactions. Compared to traditional bank wire transfer the <em>cost </em>and <i>speed</i> of blockchain transaction are hundred if not thousandfold faster and cheaper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why blockchain transactions are a perfect way to pay your suppliers.  Even on the other side of the world, they will get their money just in a few seconds (depending on the currency ). <em><strong>Fast</strong></em> settlements are crucial for suppliers giving them more access to capital, thus more opportunities to do business. If you are not the supplier but the business owner instead, you can benefit by saving from the <em><strong>cost</strong></em> of the transactions. That could be a real deal when dealing with large amounts of money.  In addition to fast and cheap, transactions are can be used to for company&#8217;s accounting and auditing. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> Blockchain can fundamentally transform businesses by eliminating inefficiencies, speeding up transactions and enabling innovative new business models,” said IBM Research China director Dr. Xiaowei Shen.&nbsp;  </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Product Traceability</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key feature of the blockchain is the ability to track the products from the manufacturer/producer site to the point of sale, thus allowing the customer to check product origin and related details before buying it. This is an invaluable feature allowing each part of the value chain to track the product from raw material provider to the customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain&#8217;s ability to enable end-to-end visibility in Supply Chain can help companies grow their ROI. According to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3790363\">Gartner Research</a>, the quantitative benefits of implementing end-to-end visibility are phenomenal:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>20% in inventory savings </li><li>25% of increased regional forecast accuracy</li><li>98% of improved service level agreements</li><li>10% reduction of workforce</li><li>30% decrease in inventory stock </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take the car industry as an example to picture the complexity of the value chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-1024x640.png\" alt=\"Supply Chain value chain in car manufacturing industry\" class=\"wp-image-1140\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-1024x640.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-300x188.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-768x480.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-922x576.png 922w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Supply Chain value chain in car manufacturing industry</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Another use case to showcase the importance of <em>traceability </em>is the food/pharma industry where both <strong>producer </strong>and <strong>customer </strong>need to make sure that the product is not a counterfeit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Producers can protect their image and market by making sure that no counterfeit products have been infiltrated into their supply chain. Low-quality counterfeit products will not only reduce the company&#8217;s market share but can also lead to brand detriment when customers buy fake products with inferior quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For customers, quality can also mean health risks when we speak about alimentary products and pharma.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Implications of food safety and pharma</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>With growing global supply chains, food safety is a top concern with both consumers and regulators. The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/foodborne-disease-estimates/en/\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;(WHO) estimates that 420,000 people die annually from food contamination, which affects one in 10 people worldwide. Children under age five are at the highest risk with 125,000 children dying every year from foodborne illness, according to WHO. </p><cite><br></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The World Health Organization pegged global fake drug sales at $75bn in 2010, a 90% increase over five years. The issue of counterfeit medicines has become increasingly pressing, both in terms of the economic cost of this global black market and the risk to human life that comes from taking counterfeit drugs that may not have the same active pharmaceutical ingredients or dosage levels.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain can eliminate those risks by allowing end users to track each item origin with the help of IoT sensors. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3> Helping the small </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond product integrity and anti-counterfeiting efforts, blockchain could also play a role in overcoming the financial challenges faced by smaller operators along the supply chain.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In China, for example, pharma retailers – which often have to wait two to three months to receive payment for delivered medicines – have experienced problems accessing financing without proper credit records and collateral, which the transparency of blockchain could provide. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Contract bid and execution</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the process of buying is automated via <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contract</a> all parties can verify it. The smart contract enables trustless trade between absolute strangers, with the capability to introduce rules for trades that are at all stages transparent and self-enforcing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Data and Governance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, besides bringing more trust the blockchain systems are also a good source of data collection because of their transparency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, their immutable nature is guaranteeing better data quality.

The sale is administered by the exchange, on behalf of the team.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>IEOs are getting more and more attention, both from business teams and investors. <em>But are they really the right solution for you to finance your business idea?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To spice-up this articles we reached out to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelovstoyan/\">Stoyan Angelov</a> CEO and Founder of <a href=\"https://www.evedo.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evedo</a> (currently running an IEO) to share his experience with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s put the appearance of the IEO&#8217;s in perspective. Before the rise of the IEO model in the blockchain space, we had witnessed the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/ico-initial-coin-offering/\">ICO</a> and STO models. We have discussed their <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/news/initial-exchange-offering-ieo-pros-and-cons/\">advantages and disadvantages</a> in previous <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain-part-2/\">blockchain and business</a> articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, mostly due to scammy projects investors lost <strong>trust</strong> and as we all know when there is no trust there is no business. But the appearance of the IEO&#8217;s seems to have solved the trust issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We can speculate that from an investor&#8217;s perspective one feels more secure when investing in a project listed on his favorite exchange. This means that by accepting to run an IEO the exchanges are putting their <em>reputation</em> at stake. Let me put this in another way. Investors <strong>trust</strong> projects because they trust the exchanges that they are running on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Stoyan, Why did choose to run an IEO?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It has been more than 1 year since we started our work on Evedo. Our team has started talking about the possibility of launching an Initial Exchange Offering for quite some time. It was our trip and remote work from Thailand that made a significant change in the way we structure our fundraising model. We received a lot of advisory on the IEO part.<br> Actually, I think that the new wave of fundraising through exchange token sales is really valuable for all the parties involved. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You as a business owner need the people to trust you so they can invest in your idea and help you develop it. So by running your IEO on a platform that is trusted, you are increasing your chances to attract more investors, thus more funds for your idea. But running your crowdfunding campaign on an exchange is having its pros and cons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to be overhyped. IEOs are not only bringing us positives, but there are also some negatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What are the CONs?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>COST / CONTROL / REACH</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As we mentioned above, if you decide to use the IEO model you are going to benefit from the exchange&#8217;s reputation, but that comes at a price. So the first thing is the <strong>cost</strong>. Be prepared to spend some money upfront in order to be able to make your campaign on a specific exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running your campaign on an exchange is going to save you time and will help you mitigate some security risks but since you do not have the private keys to your wallet you are giving up the <strong>control </strong>over your funds and tokens. Can you trust the exchange?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And third, by deciding to go with one exchange you automatically exclude all other exchanges, thus you limit your <b>reach </b>of investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What are the PROs?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>REPUTATION / LIQUIDITY / SECURITY</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fist, as we have already said, one of the main advantages to run your crowdfunding campaign on a certain exchange is its <strong>reputation</strong>. Moreover, all current customers of the exchange are becoming your potential customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, not neglectable from both investor&#8217;s and business owner&#8217;s perspective benefit is the <strong>liquidity</strong> of the token at the end of the token sale. The more liquidity &#8211; the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And last, running your campaign on an exchange can help you with reducing some <strong>security</strong> risks.  Allowing the investors to purchase the tokens on exchange as opposed to sending smart contract addresses where they have to send their tokens is lowering the risk of phishing attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What did you get from working with an exchange?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked Stoyan, and this is what he answered:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>At the current market situation, an Initial Exchange Offering simply makes sense. IEO adds some protection for the investors who participate, as the token is already listed on an exchange and the exchange is somehow the middleman who ensures credibility and trust.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Most of the exchanges do heavy due diligence on the projects before they even consider their application for IEO. This is exactly what happened to us! We waited more than 3 weeks just for the internal teams of BitForex to do due diligence on our papers, company incorporation, team, token, token economics, business model, etc. Right after that our application was processed and we started structuring when and how we are going to make it. We can say that projects that issue an IEO have increased credibility, because of the Exchange that has their backs, so to say.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We believe the IEO model assures fewer scams. When we think of the ICO wave from 2017 and 2018 we normally recall all the projects that were somehow fraudulent which led to a certain disappointment in the blockchain field in general.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>For Evedo, IEO is an interesting opportunity for two main reasons. First of all, it is a way to raise funding for further product development without the traditional VC investment model. Secondly, it is also a fruitful opportunity as a Marketing strategy and spreading the word about what we are trying to build in markets, networks, and communities who are quite different.<br></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>How did you choose your exchange?</h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was introduced to the BitForex team during the year&#8217;s TokenomX in Bangkok. We got along really well. We set up a call, and me, as well as Elena (CMO of Evedo) got a really long discussion with them. We were currently speaking with a few other exchanges at the time but we chose BitForex as we trusted their professional approach and interesting markets that they operate on.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>In your opinion, are IEOs really worth the hype?</h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We think the IEOs really worth the hype. As I mentioned in my previous answer projects that issue an IEO have increased credibility, because of the Exchange. It’s a better way to reach out to new communities, new markets. It’s an interesting opportunity now and we are happy to be a part of it.<br></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the alternatives to raise funds?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the traditional well-known ways to raise funds and the above mentioned ICO, STO and IEO there are also a bunch of other alternatives. All of them rely on code rather than on a centralized authority. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first worth mentioning is the DAICO. It&#8217;s a mix of DAO and ICO. The DAICO model was proposed by Vitalik Buterin, father of Ethereum, a few years ago. It is a fair model giving more power and control in the investor&#8217;s hands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one is the TTO (trusted token offering) using a smart contract middle layer that is distributing the funds to the developers only according to achieved milestones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And last, another decentralized solution that is allowing us to create cool token models are bonding curves. Without getting into technical details we can say that bonding curves are a great way to provide instant liquidity and a continuous funding model. An example of a project using bonding curves during a token sale was Bancor, helping them to raise over 140 million USD in just over 8 hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to expect next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As IEO was an alternative to ICO and STO, we can expect to see in the near future the appearance of new funding models, providing investors with more control and more security. In my opinion that can be in the form of DIEO (decentralized initial exchange offering), which will combine the pros of IEO and the pros of the decentralized models that we have discussed above.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great idea — but you don’t have the skill to build it – get in touch with us at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the full list of our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>We bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>What is IEO?
