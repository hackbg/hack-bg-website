Since its staggering growth in 2020, we started to witness many DeFi alternatives to traditional financial services. Open lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, and digital asset staking are among the most common use-cases, but new tools and platforms are emerging regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Benefits of DeFi:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized finance leverages key principles of the Blockchain essence to increase financial security and transparency, unlock liquidity and growth opportunities, and support an integrated and standardized economic system. With basal benefits like Immutability, Interoperability, Transparency, Permissionless, and Self-Custody, you can manage your own digital asset finances without relying on centralized financial institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>DeFi Use cases:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table style=\"border: none;\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Case-study_DeFi_pictogram_256x256-1.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 128px;\"></td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>Stablecoins &#8211; </strong>Stablecoins are a type of digital asset that have their value pegged to another asset(fiat money, or to exchange-traded commodities) in order to reduce volatility;</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Case-study_DeFi_pictogram_256x256-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\"></td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>Open lending platforms &#8211; </strong>These are decentralized applications (DApps) that allow you to either lend or borrow digital assets out to/from other users to earn interest or pay interest on top;</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Case-study_DeFi_pictogram_256x256-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\"></td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>Decentralized exchanges &#8211; </strong>DEXs are digital asset trading platforms that operate without a centralized authority and use simple mathematics to set the price of tokens in a liquidity pool;</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Case-study_DeFi_pictogram_256x256-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\"></td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>Decentralized insurance &#8211; </strong>These can be used to hedge against rare or potentially devastating events like a market crash, hack, smart contract failure, etc;</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Case-study_DeFi_pictogram_256x256-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\"></td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>Synthetic asset issuance &#8211; </strong>The process of creating a digital asset token that represents the properties of something else, like precious metals, digital assets, or \nmore complex financial instruments, like stocks and derivatives;</td></tr><tr><td><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Case-study_DeFi_pictogram_256x256-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\"></td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>Yield farming &#8211;  </strong>Also known as liquidity mining, this is the practice of locking up digital assets in return for rewards which are usually automatically delivered by a smart contract.\n.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Case-study_-DeFi_infographic-1920x1080-1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3193\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Case-study_-DeFi_infographic-1920x1080-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Case-study_-DeFi_infographic-1920x1080-1-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Case-study_-DeFi_infographic-1920x1080-1-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Case-study_-DeFi_infographic-1920x1080-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Case-study_-DeFi_infographic-1920x1080-1.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n","id":"3184","parent":2557,"excerpt":"<p>Decentralized finance &#8211; often called DeFi &#8211; refers to the shift from traditional, centralized financial systems to peer-to-peer finance enabled by decentralized technologies.
