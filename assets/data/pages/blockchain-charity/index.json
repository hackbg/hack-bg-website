Blockchain’s ability to decentralize transactions can transform accountability, decision-making, auditing, and is suitable for international transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Benefits of Blockchain for Charity:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Crypto-philanthropy promises some notable advantages for charitable organizations concerning transparency, decentralization, and tax or cost abatements. The higher level of transparency and public accountability provided by blockchain technology can ease donors&#8217; minds and encourage them to give while also reinforcing the charity&#8217;s reputation for integrity. Furthermore, the automated nature of blockchain technology has the potential to simplify the way charities are managed, automating parts of the process and reducing the overall costs by requiring fewer intermediaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Blockchain Use Cases in Charity:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table style=\"border: none;\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Case-study_Charity_pictogram_1_SMALL.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 128px;\"></td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>Traceability and transparency &#8211; </strong>One of blockchain’s most attractive features is that it enables highly visible and traceable transactions.
