Work with us to understand how your company can use blockchain as a means to secure data and enhance the trust verification processes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smart Contracts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts are programmed contracts that utilize execution in a distributed environment for enforceability. These can variously be used to support crowdfunding, blind auctions, multi-signature wallets, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ethereum</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies are turning to Ethereum, a blockchain-based platform, for broader applications of trust verification beyond just cryptocurrency including smart contracts (powered by the programming language Solidity).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">Aeternity</g></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aeternity allows development of smart contract interacting with real-world facing data. It is a scalable blockchain providing state channels and oracles as first class objects. Sophia &#8211; the language for building smart contracts on the network is functional and formally verifiable which makes it very secure and efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bitcoin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most popular cryptocurrency in the world, Bitcoin was also the first distributed blockchain. We have experience with Bitcoin Core, the underlying reference client for the currency, as well as with the digital currency itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hyperledger</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Created by the Linux Foundation, Hyperledger is a project of open-source blockchains and related tools. We have experience in Hyperledger blockchain platforms like Fabric and Sawtooth, and tools such as Cello.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Polkadot</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a Polkadot parachain using the Substrate framework is a choice some for some of our projects. Polkadot is very suitable for scaling your application and reducing gas cost of other networks. As well as writing the parachains code in Rust enabling efficiency and cross-compatibility because of the native WebAssembly support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Secret Network</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CosmWasm &#8211; framework for writing cross-chain compatible Rust smart contracts using the Cosmos SDK and WebAssembly was the choice of Secret Network. The network is fairly new but it is aiming at solving one of the main topics of concerns for end users of decentralized applications &#8211; privacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><h2><em>Questions &amp; Answers? </em></h2></p>\n\n\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1620975025343\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">What is blockchain?<br></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \"><p>A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1620975067185\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \">What value does Blockchain add to your platform?<br></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \"><p>Blockchain has changed how we perceive problems and many businesses are implementing them across many sectors including supply chain, finance, healthcare, real estate and more .
