Generally, modern manufacturers are considered a significant part of the economy and are usually associated with mass production. Often manufacturers’ supply chains are sophisticated, complex organizations with a number of nuances that can make transparency and accountability challenges — especially when it comes to the logistics of building and shipping new equipment and service parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The implementation of technological advancements as Blockchain are on the rise to enable the mechanization of production processes, as well as improve overall efficiency and productivity for the benefits of the manufacturer and end customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Benefits of Blockchain for Manufacturing:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is of particular interest to the manufacturing industry. From sourcing raw materials to delivering the finished product, blockchain can increase transparency and trust at every stage of the industrial value chain. Pain points it could help address include Supply-chain monitoring for greater transparency, Materials provenance and counterfeit detection, Identity management, Regulatory compliance, Quality assurance, and many more. Blockchain technology has the potential to radically change manufacturing supply chains, and with them, cut out the middleman, streamline processes, and improve security on the whole — as well as simplify data management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Blockchain Use cases for Manufacturing:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table style=\"border: none;\"><tbody><tr><td><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Case-study_Manufacyuring_pictogram_1_SMALL.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 128px;\"></td><td class=\"has-text-align-left\" data-align=\"left\"><strong>Simplifying and safeguarding quality checks &#8211; </strong>Blockchain can provide a flexible, comprehensive system—not owned by a single manufacturer, supplier, or operator—for logging and tracking all relevant information about parts.
