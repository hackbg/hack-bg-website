The communication is possible through a set of open-source tools such as <strong>Tendermint, Cosmos SDK, and IBC.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tendermint</strong> is a Byzantine-Fault Tolerance based solution that encloses networking and consensus layers of a blockchain to enable developers to focus on the application layer.

Core principles:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Modularity: enables the creation of modules that adapt a chosen blockchain for the custom user needs.</li><li>Security: each module encapsulates its functionality and governs the communication with other modules.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-sdk-tendermint-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2542\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-sdk-tendermint-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-sdk-tendermint-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-sdk-tendermint-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-sdk-tendermint-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-sdk-tendermint.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Cosmos SDK and modules</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Inter-Blockchain Communication</strong> protocol enables the communication between blockchains. By utilizing the instant finality of Tendermint consensus it connects heterogeneous chains together. POW chains are not part of this category because they have probabilistic-finality.<br>IBC provides sovereignty by setting validators for different blockchains that have to approve new consequent blocks on the chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cosmos makes use of star-based modular architecture which has two kinds of blockchains &#8211; Hubs and Zones. Hubs connect Zones together. Every Zone can be accessed from others through a Hub. Thus the number of connections is optimised to a minimum in order to establish communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hubs use the native token of Cosmos (ATOM) to allocate resources from one Zone to another.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-hub-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2544\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-hub-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-hub-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-hub-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-hub-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-hub.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Cosmos Hub</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Communication between probabilistic-finality chains is handled by so called Peg-Zone blockchains. It monitors the state of another blockchain to establish a finality for transactions of the blockchain it bridges.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-pegzone-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2546\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-pegzone-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-pegzone-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-pegzone-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-pegzone-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-pegzone.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Cosmos Peg Zone</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cosmos provides Vertical and Horizontal scalability.</strong><br>Vertical scalability is achieved through its consensus mechanism Tendermint BFT which could handle up to thousands of transactions per second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Horizontal scalability &#8211;  multiple parallel chains running the same application and verified by a common validator set. In theory creates infinite scalability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Resolving the aforementioned limitations of the existing blockchain networks enables more space for creative ideas and trust.
