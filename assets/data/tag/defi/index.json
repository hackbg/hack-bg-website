To achieve that DeFi relies heavily on cryptography, <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/blockchain-software-development/\">blockchain</a>, and <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/smart-contracts-vs-traditional-contracts/\">smart contracts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts are the main building blocks of DeFi. If you don&#8217;t know what smart contracts are, you can check one of the previous <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-are-smart-contracts-and-blockchain-adding-value-to-my-business/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">articles where this is discussed.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DeFi Projects. What is trendy?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is currently known that most if not all DeFi projects are built on <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Ethereum</a>. The main reason for this is that Ethereum’s programing language called Solidity allows writing advanced smart contacts that contain the most necessary logic for the DeFi applications. It is worth commemorating that Ethereum has the most advanced ecosystem across all the smart contract developers, in fact, all the applications mentioned here are built on Ethereum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article we are going to look at the different categories where DeFi is used:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Lending and borrowing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In this category, there is one main project that by this date is so far the biggest DeFi project &#8211; <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Compound</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has around 1.8 billion dollars worth of assets locked in the protocol. Compound is an algorithmic and autonomous protocol that allows users to supply assets such as Ether, DAI, Basic Attention Token(BAT), 0x, Tether, and start making interest. It also has the option to borrow other assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"401\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-1024x401.png\" alt=\"Compound finance market\" class=\"wp-image-2409\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-1024x401.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-300x117.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-768x301.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-1536x601.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-1038x406.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09.png 1742w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>https://compound.finance/markets date: 07.10.2020</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://makerdao.com/en/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">MakerDAO</a> is another project in the same category that allows users to use ETH to lend themselves money in the form of a stable coin called DAI and when users are ready to unlock their ETH, which serves as collateral for their DAI loan, they simply pay back the loan along with any fees. By combining loans with a stable currency, MakerDAO wants to allow anyone to borrow money and reliably predict how much they have to pay back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Stable coins</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of smart contracts and certain incentives a stable coin can be created pegged to the US dollar without having to store money in the real world. As we mentioned MakerDAO that locks in collateral and generates DAI. DAi is a good example of an algorithmic stable coin. Except for DAI, there are other non-algorithmic stable coins such as Tether and USD coin. The problem with them is the fact that they are centralized because there is a company that stands behind them which is responsible for holding the equivalent of the stable coins in US dollars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2398\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@bermixstudio?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Bermix Studio</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/coin?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>DEXs enables the exchange of crypto assets in a completely decentralized and permissionless way, without giving up the custody of the coins. In other words, your coins or tokens do not need to be held by a third party exchange while you trade. Decentralized exchanges can also prevent price manipulation and are more anonymous than exchanges that implement know-your-customer requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two main types of DEXs:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Liquidity Pool based is the first one. Examples for this type are &#8211; <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">UniSwap</a>, <a href=\"https://kyber.network/about/knc?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=8c58ddde734d1eb7030750ac46cf98eff58a2d6c-1602130160-0-Afgf-lIRnkrH7lOEGcF0_DHeWExaE1cuwbzCnV_J5fKVxIJNCvt3Mp8K-gDN85h8zWis_hPzNuEo0U9eVEuTgdgfaJm6qQ-cxCSH9R89CUd8jt12Y_dfImGXt_krupK3-7N7zl_odVU57vWY3mA_MtYf67QkqH-NP1gflm3CEbDV9dEBFsDQ7kdktUHoheJ1YaO1GG_w3qWtSvNLQ5XrxcFB9GZyKieQHAKASdPUu-N19y4o_k_p4um7VOK9GSSszdvkllXHiFuSOIIaaY8PZSoAStgpfjGzIZKbEOZquUXyPUteTC2eQ9KRCXjZDh0jInfHjRJpCcDkqeNBTH6rvMwSEaMyy18Sn-_n4jLF-KzJ\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Kyber network</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bancor.network/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Bankor</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Order Book based is the second type. <a href=\"https://loopring.org/#/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Loopring</a>, <a href=\"https://idex.market/eth/idex\" class=\"rank-math-link\">IDEX</a>, and <a href=\"http://weidex.market\" class=\"rank-math-link\">WeiDex</a> are examples of an order booked based decentralized exchange.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Margin Trading</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Margin trading similar to traditional finance is the practice of using borrowed funds to increase a position in certain assets. In contrast with regular trading in which traders use their own capital to fund trades, margin trading allows traders to multiply the amount of capital they are able to trade. This is why margin trading is also often referred to as leverage trading — “leverage” is the amount by which a trader is able to multiply their position. The main DeFi application in the margin trading space is <a href=\"https://fulcrum.trade/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Fulcrum</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Insurance</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance is another field of traditional finance that can be transformed into decentralized finance. Blockchain technology can contribute in many different ways enabling real-time data collection and analysis, which could make significantly speed up claims processing and payouts; ensuring that transactions are secure, authenticated, and verifiable, protecting customer&#8217;s privacy. It can provide certain kinds of guarantees of compensation in exchange for payment of premiums. One of the most popular applications are oriented with complications related to protection against smart contract failures and the protection of deposits. The most well-known insurance projects are <a href=\"https://nexusmutual.io/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Nexus Mutual </a>and <a href=\"https://opyn.co/#/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Opyn</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While more and more people are being drawn to these DeFi applications, it’s hard to say where they’ll go. Much of that depends on who finds them useful and why. Many believe various DeFi projects have the potential to become the next Robinhood, drawing in hordes of new users by making financial applications more inclusive and open to those who don’t traditionally have access to such platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for our next article piece about the Blockchain world &amp; Subscribe to our newsletter.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>What is DeFi?

His presentation started with a short evolution of money, from the exchange of goods, through the gold standard and paper money to the digital currencies. It is important to realize the chain of events that led us to the fiat currencies and the dependencies that we have created around money and on money printing organizations like FED, to realize the benefits of Decentralized Finance. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"762\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-1024x762.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1607\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-1024x762.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-300x223.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-768x571.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-774x576.jpg 774w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Tito Tiov &#8211; WeiDex</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into the details, Tito gave his best to explain to us what Decentralized Finance is, what are the use cases and what can we do on top of &#8220;Money Legos&#8221; as he called the existing DeFi platforms.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at them one by one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to the existing monetary system, where the money is printed by a government organization and the printed money is not backed by anything, since the removal of the gold standard, DeFi is based on digital assest and smart contracts build on top of blockchain protocols allowing fully transparent governance and creation of &#8220;money&#8221;, p2p lending and trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his presentation, Tito introduced us to some of the most advanced protocols build to power the growing market of DeFi dApps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, he spoke about the biggest and most famous app <a href=\"https://makerdao.com/en/\">Maker Dao</a>. Brading itself as &#8220;Transparent and sustainable finance&#8221;. Maker is comprised of a decentralized stablecoin, collateral loans, and community governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second to Maker by the number of users and revenue was Compound.  <a href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Compound </a>is an open-source, autonomous protocol built for developers, to unlock a universe of new financial applications. Interest and borrowing, for the open financial system.  Their protocol is allowing many to build new and exiting application on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Tito spoke about  <a href=\"https://www.synthetix.io/\">Synthetix</a>, running  Synths, tokens that provide exposure to assets such as gold, Bitcoin, U.S. Dollars, stocks like TESLA, and AAPL within the Ethereum blockchain.

Providing their users with excellent trading experience without the need to spend extra money on market makers and liquidity providers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly before the end, Tito walked us through a few smart contacts, showing us how we can build on top of the existing dApps or add them to our products to boost our revenues and to make the user experience richer and nicer.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, we can say that the meetup was been equally interesting and important for developers, entrepreneurs, and investors giving to each group enough information to spark their interest in Decentralized Finance witch is considered to be the next killer application of blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> What is your opinion on Defi?

We have also covered <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/ico-or-sto-7-steps-to-success/\">the steps</a> that you need to follow to bring your idea to life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, we have discussed the benefits of using blockchain and  what is the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/the-future-of-blockchain/\">foreseeable future of blockchain</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this series of articles, we would like to focus more on specific uses cases of blockchain and the and most obvious one is the use of <em><strong>Blockchain in Finance</strong></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finance is the engine of our economies and businesses.  But to have access to the financial system as a business owner up until now one needed to have an intermediary in the process. Most of the times those are the banks as well as other services providers cutting on your profits or increasing the price for the end user of your products. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Be your own bank</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With blockchain, you are your own bank. You can create your own account and operate it the way you want.  As long as you manage to keep your private keys safe you are safe. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"943\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-991\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1.png 943w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1-300x138.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1-768x354.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://advisory.kpmg.us/content/dam/advisory/en/pdfs/blockchain-future-finance.pdf\">https://advisory.kpmg.us/content/dam/advisory/en/pdfs/blockchain-future-finance.pdf</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But what exactly are the benefits for business owners to be their own bank?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Full Control</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, you have full control and full access to your funds. 24/7 365 days a year. No need to wait days for a payment to settle. When your customers pay you in crypto (ETH/BTC) you will have your money within a few seconds/minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Save Money</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, if you use crypto payments to purchase your stock you can save a lot of money on bank transfers. And third, since crypto payments are all recorded to the blockchain, you can use the records when doing your accounting, thus again you will save time and money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Automate</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to payments and money transfers, the blockchain is allowing business owners to run businesses in automated ways using smart contracts. Smart contracts are a series of instructions, written in a programming language, working on the basis of the IF-THIS-THEN-THAT logic, allowing people to have trusted interactions with each other without the need of a third party or an escrow service.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"993\" height=\"543\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-996\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2.png 993w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-300x164.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-768x420.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 993px) 100vw, 993px\" /><figcaption>Source <a href=\"https://blockgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/infographics-02-1.jpg\">https://blockgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/infographics-02-1.jpg</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Be innovative and cost-efficient </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the underlying technology of blockchain, <strong><em>the immutability,</em></strong> we can guarantee that what we see is the &#8220;truth&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, we can speak of some other benefits of using blockchain in your business.
