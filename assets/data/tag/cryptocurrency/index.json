The main distinguishing features of them are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>They improve on older cryptocurrencies by placing privacy at the core of their new design</li><li>They aren’t backward compatible since they’re a whole new cryptocurrency</li><li>They have inherently higher complexity</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, so good. Those new privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies sound like a nice deal, what are some real-world examples then? Well, let’s point out the most prominent ones and then analyze them closer. We’ll be scratching on Zerocoin, Zerocash, and Monero.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zerocoin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one, <a href=\"http://zerocoin.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Zerocoin</a>, is more of a protocol-oriented project. Quoting its creators as to what its aim is: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Zerocoin is a project to fix a major weakness in Bitcoin: the lack of privacy guarantees we take for granted in using credit cards and cash. Our goal is to build a cryptocurrency where your neighbors, friends, and enemies can’t see what you bought or for how much.</p><cite>Zerocoin website</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This very cool statement is backed by the mixing capability implemented in the <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6547123\" class=\"rank-math-link\">protocol</a> itself. Now, let’s open  Zerocoin’s hatch and see how its gears turn. The main idea is that there are two types of coins &#8211; a Basecoin (Bitcoin or some other altcoin) and a Zerocoin which serves as an extension of the Basecoin. Basecoins can be swapped for Zerocoins and vice versa. If you go back to the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/lets-talk-blockchain/cryptocurrencies-and-privacy/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">first part</a> of this post, you will see that this serves pretty much the same purpose as coin mixing and it aims to remove the linkability of the initial Basecoins. You can find a rough visualization of what happens when using only the Basecoin vs Basecoin + Zerocoin. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-1024x333.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3116\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-1024x333.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-300x97.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-768x250.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-1536x499.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-1038x337.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability.png 1828w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Transaction linkability of a Basecoin(BTC) vs. Zerocoin</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea consists of two parts: initially, a user converts a Basecoin into a Zerocoin, and then, in the future, the same user can use the Zerocoin to turn it back into a Basecoin. The protocol guarantees a curious user can’t find out exactly which Zerocoin was used to create a Basecoin, hence the initial “creator” of the Zerocoin can’t be linked. The first part (minting) is achieved through a classical cryptographic commitment. To mint a Zerocoin, a user must generate a serial number <strong><em>S</em></strong> which will be used in the future to spend the Zerocoin (this prevents double-spending), and a random secret <strong><em>r</em></strong> which must remain private (this enforces the unlinkability when spending). The commitment then is calculated as <em><strong>c := g^(S) * h^(r)</strong> </em>(<strong><em>g</em></strong> and <strong><em>h</em></strong> being hash functions) which ensures that neither <strong><em>S</em></strong> nor <strong><em>r</em></strong> can be computed by only knowing the commitment <strong><em>c</em></strong>. Once this is done, a user posts the commitment together with the hash of the Basecoin which they wish to convert to Zerocoin, and if the Basecoin is owned by them, then the minting transaction is accepted and posted on the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"272\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-1024x272.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3117\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-1024x272.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-300x80.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-768x204.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-1536x408.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-1038x275.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing.png 1828w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Zerocoin minting process</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, unlinkability hasn’t been achieved. This is done in the second part (spending). To accomplish this, the protocol utilizes several techniques, one of which is an accumulator. A closer look at how accumulators operate is shown below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"642\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-1024x642.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3118\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-1024x642.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-300x188.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-768x481.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-919x576.png 919w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Basic overview of an accumulator function</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, the accumulator in the Zerocoin protocol is used for accumulating every mint transaction on the blockchain as part of the spending phase. So, after this slight technical detour, let’s look at how Alice can spend her Zerocoins while maintaining unlinkability.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Firstly, she would have to publish the serial number <strong><em>S</em></strong> she generated at the minting phase &#8211; remember that <strong><em>c := g^(S) * h^(r)</em></strong> </li><li>Then, she should accumulate all previously minted Zerocoins (their commitments) on the blockchain &#8211; <strong><em>a</em></strong></li><li>After that, Alice will compute the public witness <strong><em>w</em></strong> for her coin</li><li>Lastly, she must create a ZKP stating that &#8220;she knows a random secret <strong><em>r</em></strong> such that a coin <strong><em>c</em></strong> is one of the minted Zerocoins”. She keeps <strong><em>r</em></strong> and <strong><em>c</em></strong> secret, of course. <br><br>The ZKP is the interesting part since it uses a logical disjunction of ZKPs for all of the Zerocoins and the whole ZKP is evaluated as true if one ZKP is valid while not revealing exactly which ZKP is valid.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-1024x577.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3119\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-1024x577.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-768x433.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-1023x576.png 1023w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Process of computing a disjunction of ZKPs</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the protocol itself doesn’t guarantee absolute unlinkability if used poorly. For once, if there are only a few people using Zerocoins, then the overall ZKP from step 4 would result in very fragile unlinkability. Another point of failure is user habits. The effectiveness of the protocol depends on the users making smart decisions, meaning that if a single user mints a Zerocoin from one address and then simply spends a Zerocoin from the same address, nothing is achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zerocash</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you visit Zerocoin’s official website, you will see the information that the protocol has been succeeded by a fully functional project called <a href=\"https://z.cash/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Zerocash</a>. So, what are the improvements?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main change is that Zerocash runs on its own and doesn’t need a Basecoin to function. Additionally, it relies on better cryptographic proof techniques (zk-SNARKs). At its core, Zerocash makes use of the notion that there are 2 address types &#8211; private (z-addresses) and transparent (t-addresses) ones which allow 4 different transaction types.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-1024x375.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3120\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-1024x375.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-300x110.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-768x281.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-1038x380.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Zcash transaction types</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The most interesting of these 4 transaction types If the Z-to-Z transaction which quoting Zerocash’s website is specified as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>A Z-to-Z transaction appears on the public blockchain, so it is known to have occurred and that the fees were paid. But the addresses, transaction amount, and the memo field are all encrypted and not publicly visible. This type of encryption is only possible through the use of zero-knowledge proofs.<br>The owner of an address may choose to disclose z-address and transaction details with trusted third parties — think auditory and compliance needs — through the use of view keys and payment disclosure.</p><cite>Zerocash website</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, Zerocash looks better than Zerocoin, but it also has some drawbacks. The main one being the inherent need for a secret random input needed to generate public parameters during the setup phase and the importance of these inputs being securely destroyed. The reason for this is if someone gets ahold of those secrets, then that person could <a href=\"http://zerocash-project.org/q_and_a#can-one-put-a-backdoor-in-zerocash\" class=\"rank-math-link\">forge</a> coins arbitrarily. This hasn’t happened yet, so we can assume the system has been safe so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Monero</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if we are looking for a cryptocurrency that is even stricter when it comes to privacy. How about something along these lines:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It’s a set of open-source privacy-focused protocols that were initially built upon Bytecoin/CryptoNode code</li><li>There’s an accepted hard-fork approximately twice a year used as a testing environment for new functions</li><li>The community interest is increasing constantly and it’s very well maintained</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, this is <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Monero</a> for you. It has its roots in this famous bitcointalk forum <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563821.0\" class=\"rank-math-link\">thread</a>. Nowadays, Monero developers have implemented several very important features that make the cryptocurrency arguably the best privacy-oriented one out there: it provides stealth addresses which aren’t the typical public addresses as in other cryptos, the transaction information is confidential meaning the transacted amounts aren&#8217;t publicly visible, and it utilizes ring signatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at the first feature, <strong><em>stealth addresses</em></strong>. Most cryptocurrencies promote the usage of a new address for every payment, however, this has often proven to be ineffective in maintaining privacy. Firstly, due to the work in modern heuristics that aim to link addresses and secondly, because at some point one user has to communicate an address to another user or service. This is why Monero tackled this problem by creating a new address management system. Stealth addresses function by allowing a user to post a general public “STEALTHADDR” which other users can use as a blueprint to create arbitrarily many different addresses and send coins to them. These coins will be accessible only by the user holding the private key to the blueprint “STEALTHADDR”. This way, a curious user can’t link different fresh addresses to the initial “STEALTHADDR”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The math behind this isn’t too complex. Let’s say Alice creates a pair of private keys &#8211; <em><strong>(a, b)</strong></em> and publishes a pair of public keys &#8211; <em><strong>(g^a, g^b)</strong></em>. After that, Bob can use those public keys to create as many fresh addresses as he wants and send money to Alice through those. For a new address, Bob generates a private random secret <strong><em>r</em></strong>, computes <strong><em>f = g^(a * r)</em></strong>, and then the new address would be <strong><em>P = g^(H(f)) * g^b</em></strong>. When sending coins, Bob also includes <strong><em>g^r</em></strong>. Now, Alice can compute the private key <strong><em>p</em></strong> for the new address <strong><em>P</em></strong> simply by calculating <strong><em>p = H(g^(a * r)) + b</em></strong> and spend the coins.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"249\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-1024x249.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3135\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-1024x249.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-300x73.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-768x187.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-1038x253.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Stealth addresses</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The next important feature is <strong><em>confidential transactions</em></strong>. Monero has correctly focused on hiding the transacted amount because that piece of information is quite heavily utilized in modern linking heuristic methods. This is achieved via the homomorphic property of commitments (confidential transactions in Monero). Besides the essential hiding and binding properties, the homomorphic one is applied so that if there are, for example, 3 commitments &#8211; a single commit for 1 coin, another commit for 4 coins, and another for 6 coins, their combination would result in a single commitment for 11 coins.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"244\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-1024x244.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3123\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-1024x244.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-300x71.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-768x183.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-1038x247.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Homomorphic property of a Pedersen commitment</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s now apply this to Monero’s confidential transactions in a practical example.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"261\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-1024x261.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3124\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-1024x261.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-300x76.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-768x196.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-1038x265.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Confidential transaction example</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, for the last essential part of Monero &#8211; <strong><em>ring signatures</em></strong>. To introduce this concept, we can start off with an example of a typical Bitcoin transaction. In it, every input has a deterministic mapping to a single output. This makes the system quite simple and easy to use at the cost of enabling transaction tracking. In contrast to this approach, ring signatures provide a cryptographic mechanism that allows many outputs to be mapped to a single input. Monero basically manages to create a transaction signature via ring signatures that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Proves that one of the secret keys was used to make a transaction</li><li>Doesn’t reveal the public key that was used in the transaction</li><li>Prevents the usage of the same public key in future transactions</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To best illustrate how this works, imagine that you are given a bucket of lego pieces that can be combined to form a circle. You also have your very own lego piece which is identical to all of the others in the bucket, but only you know that it’s your own piece. Now, you take random pieces from the bucket and, together with your piece, build a circle without anyone looking. You then take the circle, give it to someone and ask them to pick out exactly your piece. Intuitively, the success of the person depends on pure chance &#8211; the fewer pieces in the circle, the greater the chance of the person guessing which piece is exactly yours. Not only that, but if you always use the same piece, the person guessing might start noticing it, so that’s why it’s important to also use a different personal piece each time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This non-technical analogy, while basic, highlights the most essential aspects of ring signatures in Monero. For a short summary of the math behind the mechanism, you could check out the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-1024x903.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3125\" width=\"1024\" height=\"903\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-1024x903.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-300x265.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-768x678.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-653x576.png 653w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Basic example of a ring signature transaction</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ongoing research focusing on privacy in cryptocurrencies is very active. As presented in the first part of this blog post, there are several viable solutions that focus on making privacy-enhancing technology compatible with current cryptocurrencies. But, many active projects have taken this a step further and succeeded in creating new cryptocurrencies which are all about keeping coin users anonymous.<br>With the risk of repeating myself, regardless of whether you think anonymity in cryptocurrencies is important or not, privacy is something that shouldn’t be neglected! It’s such a hot topic in today’s tech world for a reason. As long as cryptocurrencies continue to strive towards being a viable and even better alternative to fiat currencies, they have to at least try and be better in every aspect possible. Of course, the physical aspect of cash seems rather impossible to replicate via a blockchain. Privacy, however, is something that could and must be improved and hopefully, developers will continue to improve this aspect of the technology that is the future &#8211; cryptocurrencies!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Privacy-enhancing cryptocurrencies While the previous blog post concerned itself with privacy-enhancing Bitcoin-compatible protocols, in this one we will analyze a [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"158","title":"Lets Talk Blockchain","path":"/category/lets-talk-blockchain/"}],"author":{"name":"Aleksandar Hadzhiyski","path":"/author/aleksandar/"}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-04-22T11:00:00","id":"3022","title":"Cryptocurrencies and privacy [part 1]","path":"/blog/cryptocurrencies-and-privacy/","content":"\n<h2>Privacy-enhancing Bitcoin-compatible protocols</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, privacy has become such an important topic within the many technologies we use in our lives that it’s only natural for us to ask the question: <strong>Where does privacy stand in the world of cryptocurrencies?</strong> The intuitive answer of many people unfamiliar with blockchain technology is that cryptocurrencies provide full anonymity and privacy. Similarly to a famous pawnshop owner bargaining on their tv show: \n<em>“Anonymity? Sorry, best I can do is pseudonymity.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a starting point, let’s define what anonymity means in the context of cryptocurrencies. The term could be explained as the sum of pseudonymity and unlinkability.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity.png\" alt=\"privacy through anonimity in cryptocurrencies\" class=\"wp-image-3024\" width=\"748\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity.png 1495w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity-300x115.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity-1024x393.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity-768x295.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity-1038x399.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><figcaption>Anonymity in cryptocurrencies</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Those two concepts are very closely intertwined and it’s important to point out that the latter isn’t simply a nice-to-have rather an essential part. I’ve heard many times the incorrect assumption that even if one’s pseudonyms (blockchain addresses) are linked, how could that possibly lead to the person behind those pseudonyms. In reality, many cryptoasset services hold some kind of personal identifiable information (PII). All it takes is one pseudonym to be linked to the PII and the thread unravels. Let’s take a closer look at the most famous cryptocurrency &#8211; Bitcoin and why it’s not fully anonymous.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Firstly, cryptoassets built on a blockchain are public and that includes both transactions and addresses.</li><li>Secondly, addresses could be linked via clustering heuristics used in different tools such as Chainalysis, CipherTrace, and GraphSense.</li><li>Lastly, as previously mentioned, many cryptoasset services hold PII that lead back to the people behind addresses.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these points lead to the fact that transactions along with senders and recipients of payments could be linked to specific users. It’s easy to see that Bitcoin is missing the unlinkability part from the anonymity equation. Not only that but also the offered privacy is arguably worse than that of traditional banking. In the end, the underlying blockchain put together with the data saved from different exchanges creates somewhat of a privacy hell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that at this point we can agree that although the early promises and expectations from cryptoassets were for anonymity, linkable payments are the de facto status quo. Looking back at more than a decade of cryptoassets, we can observe an ever-increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as means of payment. However, with great power comes great responsibility. On the one side, there’s the positive increase in acceptance, while on the other side there are all of the negative news throughout the years: the shutdown of the Silk Road Darknet Marketplace, the famous Mt. Gox hack, the Bitstamp security breach, the DAO hack, the wave of Ponzi schemes and ICO scams. If you ask me, those events are inevitable for a new and emerging technology in the field of payments. Just like every new creation there still are a lot of unknowns and problems that should closely be analyzed and solved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that spirit, let’s look at the opportunities to avoid linkability in cryptocurrencies. The first approach I will analyze is the application of Bitcoin-compatible solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Coin mixing</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3025\" width=\"748\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing.png 1495w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing-300x115.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing-1024x393.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing-768x295.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing-1038x399.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><figcaption>Tagged coins go in, untagged coins go out.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic idea of coin mixing is quite straightforward. An arbitrary amount of honest users each put the same amount of “tagged” coins as input in the mixer and wish to obtain that amount of “untagged” coin if the mixing was a success or receive back the original “tagged” coins if the mixing failed due to some reason. Of course, the described process sounds intuitively like a centralized service of sorts. There are several issues with that: the mixing service can always link coins to users and it’ll almost surely require some kind of fee. We can also mention theft by the service as a potential issue although there are protocols that can make the mixing service accountable for the number of coins (BNMCKF Mixcoin proposal). An example for a centralized trusted mixing service is bestmixer and for an untrusted mixing server &#8211; <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf\" class=\"rank-math-link\">TumbleBit</a>. Great, now that the shortcomings are pointed out, the logical question is: What about decentralized solutions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized mixing sounds great due to several reasons. There is no central service, theft is impossible, it provides inherently better anonymity and lastly, it follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s decentralized philosophy for Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>CoinJoin</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The first decentralized mixing protocol to mention is the <a href=\"https://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/fileadmin/papers/2017/2017-maurer-trustcom-coinjoin.pdf\" class=\"rank-math-link\">CoinJoin</a> protocol. I’ll try to make a very short and non-technical summary of the protocol and if you feel it’s unjust, please excuse me. The first step is to find users who also want to mix the same amount of coins as you. After that, you exchange input and output addresses for the transactions. Every user constructs their transaction (where does the user want to send coins to), sends it around, collects signatures from the other users, and before signing (confirming the transaction) also checks that their output is present. After that, the transaction with the inputs and outputs is broadcast to the Bitcoin network. So far, this protocol fulfills the decentralization and no-theft requirements. However, it introduces another big problem. That is, if a malicious user “infiltrates” the CoinJoin group, then that user knows the input/output combinations of all the other users and has no problem sharing that information with someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>CoinShuffle</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where an improved protocol called <a href=\"https://petsymposium.org/2014/papers/Ruffing.pdf\" class=\"rank-math-link\">CoinShuffle</a> comes into play. CoinShuffle’s main improvements are that it provides unlinkability (input/output combinations aren’t linkable to users) and robustness (if there’s a malicious user, they will be exposed). CoinShuffle functions similarly to a pinboard where users willing to participate indicate that by generating cryptographic key pairs and posting the public key. It’s important to note that CoinShuffle can guarantee unlinkability and robustness as long as there are at least 2 honest users on the board. The protocol itself has two main building blocks &#8211; <em>layered encryption</em> and <em>permutation</em> that ensure it can work as intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3026\" width=\"748\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption.png 1495w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption-300x115.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption-1024x393.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption-768x295.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption-1038x399.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><figcaption>Layered encryption</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3027\" width=\"748\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation.png 1495w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation-300x115.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation-1024x393.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation-768x295.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation-1038x399.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><figcaption>Permutation</figcaption></figure></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So, once the protocol is initiated, each user generates an output address and has to use the key pair with which the user “joined” the board. After that, each participant uses their signature key to sign their input address + public key and post that to the board. Then, each user applies onion encryption to their output address using the public keys of the “upcoming&#8221; users and adds that to the chain of encrypted output addresses. The idea is that the different encrypted output addresses are indistinguishable by the other users since they could decrypt only one layer and so, in the end, no user can link any output address to a specific user.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3028\" width=\"914\" height=\"243\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle.png 1828w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-300x80.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-1024x272.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-768x204.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-1536x408.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-1038x275.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px\" /><figcaption>CoinShuffle shuffling phase</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the robustness, there’s no guarantee that a malicious user wouldn&#8217;t just refuse to sign the transaction when it’s their turn and thus force the mixing to fail. There is, however, a solution for that situation as well and it’s called the blaming phase. Since the cryptographic key pair used to “post” on the pinboard is created only for the current transaction, it’s no problem to reveal all private (decryption) keys in the case of a failed transaction. Following the reveal, all encryption steps are replicated and the “malicious” user whose private key is missing can be exposed and kicked from the protocol. After that, the protocol should force the remaining participants to create new Bitcoin addresses and cryptographic key pairs for improved privacy before running again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After covering those two protocols in a somewhat informal manner, we can conclude that there’s a real possibility to enhance the privacy of Bitcoin transactions while remaining fully compatible with the currency. It is safe to say that what applies to Bitcoin, can generally be used for a great number of other cryptocurrencies as well. You might be impressed by the improvement in privacy a protocol can bring and naturally ask yourself: &#8220;Well, if the protocol’s so great, why isn’t it the norm?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s simple &#8211; users can decide for themselves to ignore it and simply use the cryptocurrency as originally designed. No one can enforce the usage of privacy-enhancing protocols on a global scale. Some wallets implement them, nevertheless, a lot of users decide to perform their transactions in a “vanilla” fashion with the idea that they don’t have anything to hide so they have no problem with their transactions being linkable. Whether that’s a correct approach or not, everyone can decide for themselves. The main point is to not lose sight of the importance of privacy in today’s world and that includes the ever-growing field of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of whether you agree with the previous statement or not, there are already solutions that try to combat the inherent privacy issues found in Bitcoin and other cryptoassets. They achieve this by taking a step further than the privacy-enhancing protocols and building new cryptocurrencies with privacy at their cores. Those privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies try to correct flaws in other cryptoassets at the cost of being inherently more complex and not having backwards compatibility. Prominent examples are Monero, Zerocoin, and Zerocash. They implement interesting improvements over older cryptocurrencies and will hopefully, continue to grow. In the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/cryptocurrencies-and-privacy-part-2/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">second part of the blog post</a>, we will dive deeper into their details to further clarify the possibilities of keeping your data private in the world of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Privacy-enhancing Bitcoin-compatible protocols Nowadays, privacy has become such an important topic within the many technologies we use in our lives [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"158","title":"Lets Talk Blockchain","path":"/category/lets-talk-blockchain/"}],"author":{"name":"Aleksandar Hadzhiyski","path":"/author/aleksandar/"}}},{"node":{"date":"2020-12-04T10:19:19","id":"2438","title":"Blockchain &amp; Wallets","path":"/blog/blockchain-wallets/","content":"\n<p>Crypto wallets are an integral part of using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. They are one of the basic pieces of infrastructure that make it possible to send and receive funds through blockchain networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we are going to cover the evolution of cryptocurrency storage and evaluate the different types of wallets so that by the end of reading this article, you would be sufficiently well-versed and educated regarding the history of wallets and be properly equipped to decide which crypto wallet option is best for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, if you are new to Blockchain and how it operates, here&#8217;s a brief <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">overview of the technology powering cryptocurrency wallets</a>, to better understand exactly how they work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How Wallets Work?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, crypto wallets don&#8217;t truly store “coins”. What owners of cryptocurrency do own is a piece of code called <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/utxo.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs)</a>. Since the cryptocurrencies never leave the blockchain space, the wallet’s work is to generate the necessary information to send and receive cryptocurrency via blockchain transactions. Among such information consists of one or more pairs of <a href=\"https://www.preveil.com/blog/public-and-private-key/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">public and private keys</a>. For the cryptocurrency investor, the cryptographic public keys and private keys are the most important elements of a cryptocurrency wallet. Public keys are similar to account usernames; they identify the wallet so that the user can receive tokens without revealing their identity. Private keys (or seed phrase) are similar to pin numbers; they allow the user to access the wallet and check balances, initiate transactions, and more. The wallet also includes an address, which is an alphanumeric identifier that is generated based on the public and private keys. Such an address is, in essence, a specific &#8220;location&#8221; on the blockchain to which coins can be sent to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically the process of a transaction is as follows: to make a transaction one will need to sign (confirm) the transaction with a private key as a digital signature. The wallet will then check with the blockchain the amount of UTXOs there are available. The blockchain will confirm the amount of UTXOs the wallet has, before sending the transaction to the nodes in the network to verify that the transaction makes sense. Transactions are then placed in a &#8216;mempool&#8217;, a waiting area for unconfirmed transactions to be chosen by miners to verify, complete, and append the transaction to the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Timeline of Bitcoin Wallets:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2009</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Satoshi Nakamoto began working on the first bitcoin wallet concurrently with his development of the Bitcoin protocol, as he knew that these coins had to be stored somewhere, and as such in February 2009, was the release of Bitcoin-Qt wallet &#8211; the first-ever Bitcoin wallet. It was a full client wallet, which meant you had to download the entire blockchain history for it to sync, which back then wasn’t an issue, since there was precious little history to record. While functionality was limited, the Qt wallet did have a few advanced features to it. In addition to sending and receiving coins and incorporating an address book, it enabled the user to digitally sign arbitrary messages, proving that they were the owner of a particular public key.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2014</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014 as the price of Bitcoin began to reach $1,000, people soon realized they needed a safer way to store their newfound wealth. A company named <a href=\"https://trezor.io/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">TREZOR</a> (Czech for &#8220;vault&#8221;)&nbsp; was the first to release a cold storage consumer hardware wallet as we know it today, the TREZOR One.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside, in 2014 the first <a href=\"https://www.ledger.com/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Ledger Nano</a> was released and quickly managed to stand out thanks to its attractive price and security features – specifically, its use of a second-factor authentication (2FA) card.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2015 &#8211; 2016</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The popular next step included larger and more defined screens for devices to further improve security while also giving something back to the whole user experience. <a href=\"https://shapeshift.com/keepkey\" class=\"rank-math-link\">KeepKey</a> is a company that hit the market in 2015 and focused on those elements and did well for itself by virtue of its large, clear display screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2016 was the year when next-gen Ledger Nano S arrived on the market. It added the now-standard screen in lieu of the 2FA card, cementing its position as one of the most popular options around and sliding into the market as the cheapest hardware wallet with a screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>2017 &#8211; now</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ledger Nano S is still standing here from 2017 and is accompanying crypto-mania that is rolling around. As one of the most highly-regarded options at the time, the Ledger was in a position to catch as much of the new market as it could carry, and the Ledger Nano S was flying off the shelves. Suddenly everyone is doing bitcoin, and there isn&#8217;t a hardware wallet manufacturer on the planet able to keep up with the unprecedented surge in demand.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Types Of  Wallets</strong>:</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2439\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/neonbrand-4N3iHYmqy_E-unsplash-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@neonbrand?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">NeONBRAND</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-wallet?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the way they operate,&nbsp; cryptocurrency wallets may be defined as &#8220;hot&#8221; or &#8220;cold&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Hot wallets:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A hot wallet is any wallet that is connected somehow to the Internet. The main purpose of holding cryptocurrency in a hot wallet is to facilitate basic transactions. Individuals looking to actually make purchases with their cryptocurrency assets might consider choosing a hot wallet. They are the ideal option for storing small amounts of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and are a fast way of spending and receiving payments. These wallets are quite easy to set up, and the funds are quickly accessible, making them convenient for traders and other frequent users.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Think of a hot wallet like your wallet today: you use it to store some cash, but not your life savings. Hot wallets are great if you make frequent payments, but not a good choice for the secure storage of bitcoins. &#8211; Jordan Tuwiner Founder, Buy Bitcoin Worldwide</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Cold wallets:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Cold wallets have no connection to the Internet. Instead, they use physical gadgets to store the keys offline, making them resistant to online hacking attempts. As such, cold wallets tend to be a much safer alternative to &#8220;storing&#8221; coins. This method is also known as cold storage and is particularly suitable for long-term investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wallets come in many forms in a matter of how they can be stored. Generally, wallets are divided into three main groups &#8211; Software wallets, Hardware wallets, and Paper wallets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Software wallets:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Software wallets come in many different types, each with its own unique features. Most of them are somehow connected to the Internet and are considered hot wallets. The following are descriptions of some of the most common types of software wallets: web, desktop, and mobile wallets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Web wallets:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2441\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-21GWwco-JBQ-unsplash-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@austindistel?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Austin Distel</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-wallet?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Web wallets are used to access blockchains through a browser interface and are also known as hot wallets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These web wallets store your private keys on a web-server (very insecure), which is constantly online and controlled by a third-party operator. Different services offer different features, some of which can link to mobile and desktop wallets and replicate your addresses across the devices you own. But bear in mind that these wallets are connected to the internet, so it is not advisable to be holding large amounts of money in them, as online wallets are more vulnerable to hacks and security attack vectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other variations of the web wallets &#8211; browser extension wallets which are running locally on your machine in your browser as an add-on or extension.  They are considered to be <em><strong>safer</strong></em> than the abovementioned &#8211; of course when they are developed by well-known trusted developers and/or with an open-sourced codebase which you can verify at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some web extension wallets allow you to store cryptocurrencies native to a specific network &#8211; for example, the MetaMask wallet that can hold an <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\">Ethereum</a> based ERC-20 or ERC-721 token.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While others such as <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-tech-talks/waellet-browser-extension-wallet-for-aeternity-blockchain-network/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Waellet</a> &#8211; browser extension wallet enabling you to transact with <a href=\"http://aeternity.com\" class=\"rank-math-link\">aeternity</a> tokens or any <a href=\"https://github.com/aeternity/AEXs/blob/master/AEXS/aex-9.md\" class=\"rank-math-link\">AEX9</a> compatible fungible tokens on the aeternity network, are also enabling you with additional developer-focused functionalities such as token creation and deployment, an integrated naming system, and more (check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/waellet/waellet/wiki/Roadmap\" class=\"rank-math-link\">roadmap</a> as well).</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Desktop wallets:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Desktop wallets are installed on a desktop computer and provide the user with complete control over the wallet. When a new desktop wallet is generated, a file called <code>wallet.dat</code> will be stored locally on your computer. This file contains the private key information used to access your cryptocurrency addresses. In general, desktop wallets may be considered safer than the web and mobile wallets, as they don’t rely on third parties for their data and are harder to steal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are still connected to the internet, which makes them less secure. However, desktop wallets are a great solution for those who make frequent transactions of small amounts from their computers. It&#8217;s crucial to just make sure your computer is clean of viruses and malware before setting up a desktop cryptocurrency wallet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Mobile wallets:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2440\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/austin-distel-EMPZ7yRZoGw-unsplash-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@austindistel?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Austin Distel</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/crypto-wallet?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile wallets function much like desktop wallets but designed specifically as smartphone applications. They are quite convenient as they allow you to send and receive cryptocurrencies through the use of QR codes. As such, mobile wallets are particularly suitable for performing daily transactions and payments, making them a viable option for spending Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the real world. Just as computers, however, mobile devices are vulnerable to<a href=\"https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/common-scams-on-mobile-devices\"> </a>malware infection. So it&#8217;s recommended that you<a href=\"https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/encryption\"> </a>backup your private keys (or seed phrase) in case your smartphone gets lost or broken.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Hardware wallets:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"397\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger-1024x397.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2442\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger-1024x397.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger-300x116.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger-768x298.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger-1536x596.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger-1038x403.jpg 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ledger.jpg 1720w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by https://www.ledger.com/</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, hardware wallets are physical, electronic devices that look like a USB flash drive, that uses a random number generator (RNG) to generate public and private keys,&nbsp; where the private key is stored in the device itself. These are cold wallets because they can only be accessed by being plugged directly into a computer and do not require an internet connection in order for a user to access their cryptocurrency funds.&nbsp;Some of the newer editions are enabled with Bluetooth so you can use them with your mobile phone as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hardware wallets are by far the most secure type of cryptocurrency wallet and are practically immune to virus attacks and there have been no verifiable incidents of money being stolen from a hardware wallet. If a cryptocurrency investor’s plan is to hold crypto for a long time or is holding large amounts of cryptocurrency &#8211; a hardware wallet is the ideal option for storing those. These devices, however, are the only wallets that are not free, and they can cost up to $200 and are often referred to as not user friendly and can be challenging for new users to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Paper wallets:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"680\" height=\"280\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/etherwaller-paper-wallet.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2444\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/etherwaller-paper-wallet.jpg 680w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/etherwaller-paper-wallet-300x124.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /><figcaption>Photo by https://cryptomining-blog.com/</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Paper wallets also make use of public and private keys. Cryptocurrency users wishing to store their holdings in a paper wallet typically involves printing out an address and its private key onto a piece of paper. To set up a paper wallet, one should visit a wallet generator website or run one locally which will generate a keypair and present the keys in the form of QR codes. These codes can then be scanned using a mobile or another device to import in wallet software and later execute cryptocurrency transactions. It&#8217;s generally advised that users unplug their Internet access while the keys are being generated and that users wipe their Internet history after the keys have been created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to understand those paper wallets aren&#8217;t suitable for sending funds partially, but only their entire balance at once. If you want to spend part of the funds, you should first send all the tokens to another type of wallet (e.g., software wallet), and only then spend part of the funds. Although a paper wallet is considered an extremely secure way to keep bitcoins safe from cyber-attacks, malware, etc., they also come with risks, some of them severe. If the printer used for getting those on the paper used inexpensive ink, it may run or fade with time, wallet software no longer recognizes the private key format of the printed wallet, or the paper is lost, stolen, ripped, or otherwise damaged, making the wallet inaccessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Concussion:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each wallet type has its advantages and disadvantages, so it&#8217;s crucial to understand how they work and what you are going to use it for before making a choice with a wallet. For most users who are used to making on-the-go transactions, mobile wallets are the best option. However, hot storage systems are exposed to hackers and malware infection. If you are looking for long-term investment hardware and paper-based versions of wallets are the most secure alternatives for the job.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what wallet you choose to use, it’s important to remember to never share your private keys or the seed phrase, to keep both your wallet and mobile/desktop software up to date, to make regular backups, and enable multi-factor authentication features whenever possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have more questions regarding crypto wallets or anything concerning blockchain technology, don&#8217;t hesitate to contact Hack&#8217;s team! </p>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"tw-target-text\" class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"> </pre>\n","excerpt":"<p>Crypto wallets are an integral part of using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
