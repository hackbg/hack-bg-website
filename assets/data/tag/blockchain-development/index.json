His presentation started with a short evolution of money, from the exchange of goods, through the gold standard and paper money to the digital currencies. It is important to realize the chain of events that led us to the fiat currencies and the dependencies that we have created around money and on money printing organizations like FED, to realize the benefits of Decentralized Finance. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"762\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-1024x762.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1607\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-1024x762.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-300x223.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-768x571.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-774x576.jpg 774w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Tito Tiov &#8211; WeiDex</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into the details, Tito gave his best to explain to us what Decentralized Finance is, what are the use cases and what can we do on top of &#8220;Money Legos&#8221; as he called the existing DeFi platforms.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at them one by one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to the existing monetary system, where the money is printed by a government organization and the printed money is not backed by anything, since the removal of the gold standard, DeFi is based on digital assest and smart contracts build on top of blockchain protocols allowing fully transparent governance and creation of &#8220;money&#8221;, p2p lending and trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his presentation, Tito introduced us to some of the most advanced protocols build to power the growing market of DeFi dApps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, he spoke about the biggest and most famous app <a href=\"https://makerdao.com/en/\">Maker Dao</a>. Brading itself as &#8220;Transparent and sustainable finance&#8221;. Maker is comprised of a decentralized stablecoin, collateral loans, and community governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second to Maker by the number of users and revenue was Compound.  <a href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Compound </a>is an open-source, autonomous protocol built for developers, to unlock a universe of new financial applications. Interest and borrowing, for the open financial system.  Their protocol is allowing many to build new and exiting application on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Tito spoke about  <a href=\"https://www.synthetix.io/\">Synthetix</a>, running  Synths, tokens that provide exposure to assets such as gold, Bitcoin, U.S. Dollars, stocks like TESLA, and AAPL within the Ethereum blockchain. And<a href=\"https://instadapp.io/\"> Insta dApp</a>,  Autonomous Banking Portal on Emerging Blockchain-based Financial Protocols.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the above-mentioned protocols and dApps could be used as building blocks of your future DeFi dApp, instantly and without need to pay additional fees.  One can easily start a new business only by building a fancier UI on top of Compound&#8217;s protocol as Tito mentioned in one of his examples of successful ways to use the existing infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"552\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1024x552.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1608\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1024x552.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-300x162.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-768x414.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1038x559.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image.png 1227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>money legos in practice</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As a CEO of WeiDex, Tito shared with us his company experience of using &#8220;money legos&#8221; in practice to boost the liquidity on their multi-chain decentralized exchange. Providing their users with excellent trading experience without the need to spend extra money on market makers and liquidity providers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly before the end, Tito walked us through a few smart contacts, showing us how we can build on top of the existing dApps or add them to our products to boost our revenues and to make the user experience richer and nicer.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, we can say that the meetup was been equally interesting and important for developers, entrepreneurs, and investors giving to each group enough information to spark their interest in Decentralized Finance witch is considered to be the next killer application of blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> What is your opinion on Defi?

Thanks to all the people that came and our awesome guest <strong>Rali Ralev</strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://weidex.market\">WeiDex</a></strong> we had not only learned cool stuff about Tron but also have had a lot of fun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was by far the funniest and maybe most interactive meetup that we have ever had. I encourage you, future guest and speakers, to be more involved in the meetups, as they are not ours but yours 🙂 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to fill these community events with moments of sharing and learning but also make them cozy and fun. At the end of the day, we are all in the same boat, struggling with the same problems and fighting the same monsters 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let me tell you what have you missed beside the fun if you did not manage to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blockchain Developers News Digest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the first part we had our CEO <strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/milen_radkov\">Milen Radkov</a> </strong>made a quick tour of relevant developers news. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milen started with a last minute call to all teams to update their <a href=\"http://infura.io\">Infura</a> legacy keys before they die on the 27th of March. It turned out to be a useful warning as some devs have missed this incoming major update. Along with the legacy keys, Infura users will benefit after the update from new API Security section that could be found in the dashboard. Infura is also promising premium services coming up soon after the update. So stay tuned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we learned about <strong>Embark 4.0</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you unfamiliar with what Embark is :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Framework by Status</li><li>Out of beta and ready for developers</li><li>Including Cockpit – An intuitive Web Interface<ul><li><strong>Dashboard</strong> &#8211; provides an overview of all processes controlled by Embark (interact with Ethereum, IPFS, ENS, Whisper)</li><li><strong>Blockchain explorer</strong></li><li><strong>Iterative Deployer &#8211; </strong>enables selective deployment of smart contracts to any network</li><li><strong>Code editor &#8211; </strong>contracts even get redeployed as changes are saved</li></ul></li><li>Integrated debugger &#8211; easy way to debug contracts by displaying solidity source codes lines where a transaction failed</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> Milen shared with us the novelties in Truffle v5.0.9 including new multi-chain infrastructure that enables basic Quorum support and debugger improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did not miss to mention about the <strong>Ganache v2.0 &#8211; Chocolate Birthday Cake 🎂    </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>bringing in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>New features<ul><li><strong>Workspaces &#8211; </strong>save your development blockchains in workspaces</li><li><strong>Contract State Decoding</strong></li><li><strong>Event Decoding &#8211; </strong>events that have fired during this chain&#8217;s life</li></ul></li><li>New options<ul><li><strong>Hardfork-</strong> option to change the hardfork. Possible options are: Petersburg, Constantinople, and Byzantium.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Another worth mentioning news was the release of Peter Tsankov’s team of ChainSecuriy &#8211; Soltix. Soltix is a scalable framework for automated testing of Solidity compilers allowing us to test Solidity compiler and EVM automatically. How cool is this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly Milen spoke about the shutting down of Mist and the release of the alpha version of the Playground &#8211; for generalized state channels built with the Counterfactual framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we proceed with <g class=\"gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"8\" data-gr-id=\"8\">Rali&#8217;s</g> presentation we took time to announce our recent <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/events/hack-partners-with-wearedevelopers/\">partnership with WeAreDevelopers</a> world congress and to share with the community the perks we get from it.

Rali covered also the types of Nodes, the Governance mechanism, how one can write Tron Smart Contracts and Tools you can use to help you in your development process. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-2 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"894\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=894\" class=\"wp-image-894\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Rali Ralev, co-founder of WeiDex talking about Tron network</figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"895\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=895\" class=\"wp-image-895\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Rali Ralev, co-founder of WeiDex talking about Tron network</figcaption></figure></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can watch the whole recording of the meetup here:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/whsSoP-_Ga8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Introduction to Tron &#8211; 0x08 [Blockchain Developers Meetup]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, Rali, and thanks to all of you who attended and to those of you who read this post till the end!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wEmk4bronJqNgst_d8BIXzE9Vig8JbUqRYIDDpEaxfA/edit?usp=sharing\">Milen&#8217;s presentation &#8211; blockchain developers news digest</a></li><li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tbeJIu5yaK-9SEdZCv1EzAQBtAuXteui\">Rali&#8217;s presentation &#8211; Tron network</a></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Earlier this week we had our 8th Blockchain Developers Meetup.

And as we can see the team has come a long way in a very short period of time. In only thirteen months the team managed to deliver over 68,000 lines of core code and more than 100k lines altogether. They have launched several testnets each of them to support and test all new features. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Present</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><g class=\"gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"7\" data-gr-id=\"7\">Currently</g> the team has been working on 1.0 beta of the third generation of <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">blockchain</g> technology stack, Substate. Another cool thing that Polkdot&#8217;s team has been working on is the release of “Alexander” test net. The team is considering this their third major milestone. “Alexander” test net is important because it&#8217;s going to feature the audit-ready GRANDPA finalization algorithm, an overhaul to the cryptography and further improved governance logic including lock-voting and delayed-enactment.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the previous development the team is already ahead of schedule but <g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">nevertheless</g> there is one more key milestone to reach: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ICMP or, to the uninitiated, Inter-Chain Message Passing. scheduled to happen over the first three months of 2019, with a test net incorporating it, scheduled to be launched in April. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-575\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption> Milen Radkov talking at polkadot sofia</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Simultaneously, the team has been <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">finalising</g> the “nominated proof-of-stake” scheme and building in <g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">parachain</g> consensus into Substrate, allowing Substrate chains to plug <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">in to</g> the global blockchain network that is Polkadot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this is done and the key features are implemented, there’s going to be a period of around six months of extensive testing before we can see the launch of Polkadot 1.0. Uhhuu, Exciting future for blockchain technology.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After learning a bit more about the project and its goals we had to see some code, to understand it&#8217;s full power.
