Gaming, Supply Chain Music, and Art were some of the industries that were covered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;NFTs have a lot of uncovered potentials.</p><p>It was very interesting to follow different art, designer and digital creators, starting to embrace NFTs as a new way to monetize their work as blockchain is becoming more accessible to a wider audience.‚Äù</p><cite>Milen</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed the element of subjectivity in art and&nbsp; Who decides what is the value of an art piece that is an&nbsp; NFTs of some sort?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Well, basically, market, just like in the regular space, if someone is willing to pay.</p><p> A banana taped to a wall for $120 000, if someone is willing to pay for that, then that is the price. The price covering the NFTs art is working with the same mechanism as the regular art only a bit fancier&#8221;.</p><cite>Luka</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the key moments were when discussing existential and pragmatic questions like how digital art is going to be presented to the world, how you will ‚Äúhang it‚Äù&nbsp; and how the trend should be set.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about virtual space where you hang it in the middle of your wallet, it&#8217;s because the first thing somebody does is check out your wallets. And to see what are you holding crypto, and also NFTs. So, it&#8217;s like, inviting people to your house to see your artwork, but in your wallet.‚Äù </p><cite>Luka</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Or just imagine some virtual museum tours around digital art emerging out of this non-fungible tokens hype. So I think this from one side, it&#8217;s too difficult to grasp from the traditional art that we&#8217;re used to seeing. But from other perspectives, it brings up a lot of new models that may emerge as businesses and as ways to communicate or to cherish or see art in general.‚Äù </p><cite>Milen</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest lies within your imagination üôÇ</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We debated about what is behind the hype and why there is hype behind it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;And my opinion is that it represents a unique way of earning money for people who were basically, we have gatekeepers all around them, musicians, artists gaming, but anything that is expressive, which was unable to be directly monetized, and now it&#8217;s monetizable.‚Äù</p><cite>Luka</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We concluded that every generation has something of its own. Now real artists have many new exchanges and platforms that are emerging that are allowing them to create or trade or invest in portfolios. Now, after several years of development, the user interfaces and the whole user journey and flow are smoother than it was once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But still,  there is a lot more to go. And we think that&#8217;s also a topic to be brought up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this the optimal way to use NFTs? Or should it be more simple for people or users or regular non-tech people? For example, someone that is not technically advanced? Why shouldn&#8217;t they use NFT&#8217;s in digital arts or digital collectibles of some sort? And what is the next big thing for NFTs?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those and more questions were on the agenda for our first hackCast. But we want to hear your opinion on the topic as well.&nbsp;Comment below or contact if you have some interesting idea you want to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We thank our first guests Milen and Luka for the interesting conversation and the friendly and congenial atmosphere they created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are looking forward to the next hackCast!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Hey guys, yesterday (Mar 1) our first hackCast took place on the Clubhouse app.&nbsp; For the first topic we selected [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"9","title":"Blog","path":"/category/blog/"},{"id":"5","title":"Events","path":"/category/events/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"}}},{"node":{"date":"2020-02-04T17:43:42","id":"1742","title":"Art in blockchain and blockchain in art","path":"/blog/blockchain-art/","content":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/blockchain_art-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Blockchain in Art\" class=\"wp-image-1740\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/blockchain_art-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/blockchain_art-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/blockchain_art-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/blockchain_art.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Blockchain in Art</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain wants to be the parsley of every dish and one of the many fields of expression is the art industry. You may all have heard of the CryptoKitties and Rare Pepe trading cards as the most popular form of blockchain art, but if we dig deep down into what really blockchain can do for the art industry, it‚Äôs not merely CryptoKitties.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"#authenticity-problem\">Authenticity</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#Fractional-ownership\">Fractional ownership</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#Digital-ownership\">Digital ownership </a>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#Invest-in-artist\">Invest in artist</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><p id=\"authenticity-problem\"><strong>Authenticity problem</strong></p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>An article published by The Daily Beast shows that 50 % of the art in circulation is fake. That means everything from the artist, the painting to the origin and region can be forged. And since Blockchain is all about transparency and building trust, people came up with a solution to deal with this issue. In order to prove authenticity, artists now can attach gadgets (like the one your dog might have to avoid being lost) to their artwork and later being scanned for all the information a collector needs to prove provenance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Blockchain development is still in progress and is yet not time-tested so problem can occur in a matter of safety. The problem here might be in the IoT devices that have a public key that is generated by the manufacturer, which is creating conditions for duplications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"Fractional-ownership\"><strong>Fractional ownership</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By breaking to small fragments the monolithic painting and tokenizing it, sellers are able to fragment the ownership of the artwork using blockchain. Surprisingly, people get excited to participate in a new model of ownership and let‚Äôs say own a fraction of Andy Warhol‚Äôs ‚Äú14 Small Electric Chairs‚Äù. This innovation improves valuation of artwork because of the interest it can attract.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using fractional ownership, people who have never been associated as collectors, can get involved in the art market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"Digital-ownership\"><strong>Digital ownership&nbsp;</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to what is said above, we actually get to talk about Cryptokitties. What they‚Äôre really showing us is the fact that people do not want to buy traditional art and what they are buying is a new form of digital collectible. People are actually ok with buying things that can not be touched and exist only in a&nbsp; digital environment, but are interesting and innovative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you need to know that is you don‚Äôt actually own the image, but the code and it gives you the right only to trade or sell it.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><p id=\"Invest-in-artist\"><strong>Invest in artist</strong><br></p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creators can tokenize themselves, putting them on the market place. It‚Äôs like stock market for artist and you can invest in their career.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing in an artist sets a kind of relationship which could be defined by a smart contract, describing what perc–µntage the investor owns, for what period of time and how dividends are distributed. Binding it with smart contracts about the artist‚Äôs artwork sale, investors obtain a&nbsp; percentage of the profit or investors buy tokens and later getting a discount of the artwork‚Äôs price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particip–∞nts‚Äôs job is to set the terms that suit them the most, as long as cryptocurrency is paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology is making us change the concept of how we interact with the surrounding world. It changes artwork outview, making it easier, more transparent and in interesting way, developing new manners of creating and trading art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain wants to be the parsley of every dish and one of the many fields of expression is the art [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"18","title":"Blockchain and Business","path":"/category/blockchain-and-business/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"}}}]}}},"context":{}}
