The sale is administered by the exchange, on behalf of the team.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>IEOs are getting more and more attention, both from business teams and investors. <em>But are they really the right solution for you to finance your business idea?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To spice-up this articles we reached out to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelovstoyan/\">Stoyan Angelov</a> CEO and Founder of <a href=\"https://www.evedo.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evedo</a> (currently running an IEO) to share his experience with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s put the appearance of the IEO&#8217;s in perspective. Before the rise of the IEO model in the blockchain space, we had witnessed the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/ico-initial-coin-offering/\">ICO</a> and STO models. We have discussed their <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/news/initial-exchange-offering-ieo-pros-and-cons/\">advantages and disadvantages</a> in previous <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain-part-2/\">blockchain and business</a> articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, mostly due to scammy projects investors lost <strong>trust</strong> and as we all know when there is no trust there is no business. But the appearance of the IEO&#8217;s seems to have solved the trust issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We can speculate that from an investor&#8217;s perspective one feels more secure when investing in a project listed on his favorite exchange. This means that by accepting to run an IEO the exchanges are putting their <em>reputation</em> at stake. Let me put this in another way. Investors <strong>trust</strong> projects because they trust the exchanges that they are running on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Stoyan, Why did choose to run an IEO?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It has been more than 1 year since we started our work on Evedo. Our team has started talking about the possibility of launching an Initial Exchange Offering for quite some time. It was our trip and remote work from Thailand that made a significant change in the way we structure our fundraising model. We received a lot of advisory on the IEO part.<br> Actually, I think that the new wave of fundraising through exchange token sales is really valuable for all the parties involved. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You as a business owner need the people to trust you so they can invest in your idea and help you develop it. So by running your IEO on a platform that is trusted, you are increasing your chances to attract more investors, thus more funds for your idea. But running your crowdfunding campaign on an exchange is having its pros and cons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to be overhyped. IEOs are not only bringing us positives, but there are also some negatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What are the CONs?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>COST / CONTROL / REACH</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As we mentioned above, if you decide to use the IEO model you are going to benefit from the exchange&#8217;s reputation, but that comes at a price. So the first thing is the <strong>cost</strong>. Be prepared to spend some money upfront in order to be able to make your campaign on a specific exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running your campaign on an exchange is going to save you time and will help you mitigate some security risks but since you do not have the private keys to your wallet you are giving up the <strong>control </strong>over your funds and tokens. Can you trust the exchange?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And third, by deciding to go with one exchange you automatically exclude all other exchanges, thus you limit your <b>reach </b>of investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What are the PROs?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>REPUTATION / LIQUIDITY / SECURITY</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fist, as we have already said, one of the main advantages to run your crowdfunding campaign on a certain exchange is its <strong>reputation</strong>. Moreover, all current customers of the exchange are becoming your potential customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, not neglectable from both investor&#8217;s and business owner&#8217;s perspective benefit is the <strong>liquidity</strong> of the token at the end of the token sale. The more liquidity &#8211; the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And last, running your campaign on an exchange can help you with reducing some <strong>security</strong> risks.  Allowing the investors to purchase the tokens on exchange as opposed to sending smart contract addresses where they have to send their tokens is lowering the risk of phishing attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What did you get from working with an exchange?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked Stoyan, and this is what he answered:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>At the current market situation, an Initial Exchange Offering simply makes sense. IEO adds some protection for the investors who participate, as the token is already listed on an exchange and the exchange is somehow the middleman who ensures credibility and trust.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Most of the exchanges do heavy due diligence on the projects before they even consider their application for IEO. This is exactly what happened to us! We waited more than 3 weeks just for the internal teams of BitForex to do due diligence on our papers, company incorporation, team, token, token economics, business model, etc. Right after that our application was processed and we started structuring when and how we are going to make it. We can say that projects that issue an IEO have increased credibility, because of the Exchange that has their backs, so to say.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We believe the IEO model assures fewer scams. When we think of the ICO wave from 2017 and 2018 we normally recall all the projects that were somehow fraudulent which led to a certain disappointment in the blockchain field in general.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>For Evedo, IEO is an interesting opportunity for two main reasons. First of all, it is a way to raise funding for further product development without the traditional VC investment model. Secondly, it is also a fruitful opportunity as a Marketing strategy and spreading the word about what we are trying to build in markets, networks, and communities who are quite different.<br></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>How did you choose your exchange?</h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was introduced to the BitForex team during the year&#8217;s TokenomX in Bangkok. We got along really well. We set up a call, and me, as well as Elena (CMO of Evedo) got a really long discussion with them. We were currently speaking with a few other exchanges at the time but we chose BitForex as we trusted their professional approach and interesting markets that they operate on.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>In your opinion, are IEOs really worth the hype?</h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We think the IEOs really worth the hype. As I mentioned in my previous answer projects that issue an IEO have increased credibility, because of the Exchange. Itâs a better way to reach out to new communities, new markets. Itâs an interesting opportunity now and we are happy to be a part of it.<br></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the alternatives to raise funds?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the traditional well-known ways to raise funds and the above mentioned ICO, STO and IEO there are also a bunch of other alternatives. All of them rely on code rather than on a centralized authority. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first worth mentioning is the DAICO. It&#8217;s a mix of DAO and ICO. The DAICO model was proposed by Vitalik Buterin, father of Ethereum, a few years ago. It is a fair model giving more power and control in the investor&#8217;s hands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one is the TTO (trusted token offering) using a smart contract middle layer that is distributing the funds to the developers only according to achieved milestones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And last, another decentralized solution that is allowing us to create cool token models are bonding curves. Without getting into technical details we can say that bonding curves are a great way to provide instant liquidity and a continuous funding model. An example of a project using bonding curves during a token sale was Bancor, helping them to raise over 140 million USD in just over 8 hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to expect next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As IEO was an alternative to ICO and STO, we can expect to see in the near future the appearance of new funding models, providing investors with more control and more security. In my opinion that can be in the form of DIEO (decentralized initial exchange offering), which will combine the pros of IEO and the pros of the decentralized models that we have discussed above.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great ideaâââbut you donât have the skill to build it â get in touch with us at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the full list of our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>We bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>What is IEO?

But to have access to the financial system as a business owner up until now one needed to have an intermediary in the process. Most of the times those are the banks as well as other services providers cutting on your profits or increasing the price for the end user of your products. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Be your own bank</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With blockchain, you are your own bank. You can create your own account and operate it the way you want.

No need to wait days for a payment to settle. When your customers pay you in crypto (ETH/BTC) you will have your money within a few seconds/minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Save Money</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, if you use crypto payments to purchase your stock you can save a lot of money on bank transfers. And third, since crypto payments are all recorded to the blockchain, you can use the records when doing your accounting, thus again you will save time and money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Automate</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to payments and money transfers, the blockchain is allowing business owners to run businesses in automated ways using smart contracts. Smart contracts are a series of instructions, written in a programming language, working on the basis of the IF-THIS-THEN-THAT logic, allowing people to have trusted interactions with each other without the need of a third party or an escrow service.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"993\" height=\"543\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-996\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2.png 993w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-300x164.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/2-768x420.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 993px) 100vw, 993px\" /><figcaption>Source <a href=\"https://blockgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/infographics-02-1.jpg\">https://blockgeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/infographics-02-1.jpg</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Be innovative and cost-efficient </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the underlying technology of blockchain, <strong><em>the immutability,</em></strong> we can guarantee that what we see is the &#8220;truth&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides, we can speak of some other benefits of using blockchain in your business.

Thanks to all the people that came and our awesome guest <strong>Rali Ralev</strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://weidex.market\">WeiDex</a></strong> we had not only learned cool stuff about Tron but also have had a lot of fun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was by far the funniest and maybe most interactive meetup that we have ever had. I encourage you, future guest and speakers, to be more involved in the meetups, as they are not ours but yours ð </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to fill these community events with moments of sharing and learning but also make them cozy and fun. At the end of the day, we are all in the same boat, struggling with the same problems and fighting the same monsters ð</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let me tell you what have you missed beside the fun if you did not manage to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blockchain Developers News Digest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the first part we had our CEO <strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/milen_radkov\">Milen Radkov</a> </strong>made a quick tour of relevant developers news. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milen started with a last minute call to all teams to update their <a href=\"http://infura.io\">Infura</a> legacy keys before they die on the 27th of March. It turned out to be a useful warning as some devs have missed this incoming major update. Along with the legacy keys, Infura users will benefit after the update from new API Security section that could be found in the dashboard. Infura is also promising premium services coming up soon after the update. So stay tuned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we learned about <strong>Embark 4.0</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you unfamiliar with what Embark is :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Framework by Status</li><li>Out of beta and ready for developers</li><li>Including Cockpit â An intuitive Web Interface<ul><li><strong>Dashboard</strong> &#8211; provides an overview of all processes controlled by Embark (interact with Ethereum, IPFS, ENS, Whisper)</li><li><strong>Blockchain explorer</strong></li><li><strong>Iterative Deployer &#8211; </strong>enables selective deployment of smart contracts to any network</li><li><strong>Code editor &#8211; </strong>contracts even get redeployed as changes are saved</li></ul></li><li>Integrated debugger &#8211; easy way to debug contracts by displaying solidity source codes lines where a transaction failed</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> Milen shared with us the novelties in Truffle v5.0.9 including new multi-chain infrastructure that enables basic Quorum support and debugger improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did not miss to mention about the <strong>Ganache v2.0 &#8211; Chocolate Birthday Cake ð    </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>bringing in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>New features<ul><li><strong>Workspaces &#8211; </strong>save your development blockchains in workspaces</li><li><strong>Contract State Decoding</strong></li><li><strong>Event Decoding &#8211; </strong>events that have fired during this chain&#8217;s life</li></ul></li><li>New options<ul><li><strong>Hardfork-</strong> option to change the hardfork. Possible options are: Petersburg, Constantinople, and Byzantium.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Another worth mentioning news was the release of Peter Tsankovâs team of ChainSecuriy &#8211; Soltix. Soltix is a scalable framework for automated testing of Solidity compilers allowing us to test Solidity compiler and EVM automatically. How cool is this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly Milen spoke about the shutting down of Mist and the release of the alpha version of the Playground &#8211; for generalized state channels built with the Counterfactual framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we proceed with <g class=\"gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"8\" data-gr-id=\"8\">Rali&#8217;s</g> presentation we took time to announce our recent <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/events/hack-partners-with-wearedevelopers/\">partnership with WeAreDevelopers</a> world congress and to share with the community the perks we get from it.

Rali covered also the types of Nodes, the Governance mechanism, how one can write Tron Smart Contracts and Tools you can use to help you in your development process. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-2 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"894\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=894\" class=\"wp-image-894\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Rali Ralev, co-founder of WeiDex talking about Tron network</figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"895\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=895\" class=\"wp-image-895\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Rali Ralev, co-founder of WeiDex talking about Tron network</figcaption></figure></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can watch the whole recording of the meetup here:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/whsSoP-_Ga8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Introduction to Tron &#8211; 0x08 [Blockchain Developers Meetup]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, Rali, and thanks to all of you who attended and to those of you who read this post till the end!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wEmk4bronJqNgst_d8BIXzE9Vig8JbUqRYIDDpEaxfA/edit?usp=sharing\">Milen&#8217;s presentation &#8211; blockchain developers news digest</a></li><li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tbeJIu5yaK-9SEdZCv1EzAQBtAuXteui\">Rali&#8217;s presentation &#8211; Tron network</a></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Earlier this week we had our 8th Blockchain Developers Meetup.

The participants in the votes (the so-called &#8220;bakers&#8221;) had the possibility to chose between 2 proposals. Athens A and Athens B. But before we look into the process in details let&#8217;s first say few words about tezos for those of you who are unfamiliar with the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tezos is a distributed ledger built on blockchain that is designed to facilitate the building of <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contracts</a> while allowing for the evolution of the platform in an organic manner. The Tezos blockchain is meant to be self-evolving and capable of amending functions based on the communityâs determination thanks to the protocol&#8217;s on-chain governance process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But how exactly does the on-chain governance works? Understanding the Tezos amendment process.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amendment process can be broken into four discrete periods: the Proposal Period, the Exploration or âTestingâ Vote Period, the Testing Period, and the Promotion Vote Period. Each of these four periods lasts eight baking cycles (i.e. 32,768 blocks or roughly 22 days, 18 hours), comprising almost exactly three months from proposal to activation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"974\" height=\"689\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tezos-governance-mechanism.jpg\" alt=\"tezos-governance-mechanism\" class=\"wp-image-840\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tezos-governance-mechanism.jpg 974w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tezos-governance-mechanism-300x212.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tezos-governance-mechanism-768x543.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tezos-governance-mechanism-814x576.jpg 814w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\" /><figcaption>Tezos Decentralized Voting.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Ðny failure to proceed to the subsequent period reverts the network back to a Proposal Period. In other words, failure to proceed restarts the entire amendment process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tezos decentralized vote system is a step towards  the creation of <a href=\"https://medium.com/tezos/blockchains-are-not-startups-16449e210a61\">internet-based-institutions</a> that are built to last, ones that can be adopted sustainably by hundreds of millions, if not billions of users some day. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>More information can be found at:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://tezos.com/static/white_paper-2dc8c02267a8fb86bd67a108199441bf.pdf\">Tezos white paper</a></li><li><a href=\"https://tezos.com/static/position_paper-841a0a56b573afb28da16f6650152fb4.pdfï»¿\">Tezos position paper</a></li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/tezos/amending-tezos-b77949d97e1e\">Amending Tezos blog post</a></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>What it is and how it works?

What are the benefits? How to develop them and what are they good for? <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milen Radkov had prepared for us some exciting presentation. Let&#8217;s find out!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who could not attend we would like to give you the meetup plan. This time we had 2 parts. On the first <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">part</g> we <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">talked</g> how things in Polkadot work in theory and on the second part we focused on the code and the tools that are doing the magic.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started with the well know to all blockchain developers Smart Contracts functions. When we think about it &#8211; it is really cool that one can write a dApp and push it to the network without permission, knowing that this app will live âforeverâ without worrying that somebody is going to change his logic, but we all know that the current solutions are not perfect. We are also limited by the computational complexity and the price that we have to pay for it. Not to mention that your code is good to go forever but only on one chain.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p> So what are the alternatives? </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And why are we excited to follow the development of projects like Polkadot.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In Polkadot transactions are unmetered /so you can have extremely complex state transition functions and never have to think about running out of gas/</li><li>Parachains are like building your own blockchain and not have to think about security, because of the shared security mechanism that Polkadot provides</li><li>One can trust the Polkadot validator set that they are securing the chain</li><li>Interoperability &#8211; you can message between all the different <g class=\"gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"9\" data-gr-id=\"9\">parachains</g> /message passing/ async</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second part of the meetup, we deep dived into the code to discover the advantages of using Polakot and Substrate. For those of you who are new to Polkadot, Substrate is a framework allowing us to build entirely new blockchain only in few commands, stepping up on Polkadot&#8217;s development and helping us developers to focus on our business logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-721\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Substrate module example</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>During the code review, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/milen_radkov\">Milen</a> showed us how quick it is to run a custom <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">parachain</g> with a simple betting game ruining on it.
