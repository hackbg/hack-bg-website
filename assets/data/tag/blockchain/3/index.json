The participants in the votes (the so-called &#8220;bakers&#8221;) had the possibility to chose between 2 proposals. Athens A and Athens B. But before we look into the process in details let&#8217;s first say few words about tezos for those of you who are unfamiliar with the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tezos is a distributed ledger built on blockchain that is designed to facilitate the building of <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contracts</a> while allowing for the evolution of the platform in an organic manner. The Tezos blockchain is meant to be self-evolving and capable of amending functions based on the community’s determination thanks to the protocol&#8217;s on-chain governance process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But how exactly does the on-chain governance works? Understanding the Tezos amendment process.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amendment process can be broken into four discrete periods: the Proposal Period, the Exploration or “Testing” Vote Period, the Testing Period, and the Promotion Vote Period. Each of these four periods lasts eight baking cycles (i.e. 32,768 blocks or roughly 22 days, 18 hours), comprising almost exactly three months from proposal to activation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tezos-governance-mechanism.jpg\" alt=\"tezos-governance-mechanism\" class=\"wp-image-840\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tezos-governance-mechanism.jpg 974w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tezos-governance-mechanism-300x212.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tezos-governance-mechanism-768x543.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/tezos-governance-mechanism-814x576.jpg 814w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\" /><figcaption>Tezos Decentralized Voting.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Аny failure to proceed to the subsequent period reverts the network back to a Proposal Period.

What are the benefits? How to develop them and what are they good for? <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milen Radkov had prepared for us some exciting presentation. Let&#8217;s find out!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who could not attend we would like to give you the meetup plan. This time we had 2 parts. On the first <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">part</g> we <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">talked</g> how things in Polkadot work in theory and on the second part we focused on the code and the tools that are doing the magic.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started with the well know to all blockchain developers Smart Contracts functions. When we think about it &#8211; it is really cool that one can write a dApp and push it to the network without permission, knowing that this app will live “forever” without worrying that somebody is going to change his logic, but we all know that the current solutions are not perfect. We are also limited by the computational complexity and the price that we have to pay for it. Not to mention that your code is good to go forever but only on one chain.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p> So what are the alternatives? </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And why are we excited to follow the development of projects like Polkadot.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In Polkadot transactions are unmetered /so you can have extremely complex state transition functions and never have to think about running out of gas/</li><li>Parachains are like building your own blockchain and not have to think about security, because of the shared security mechanism that Polkadot provides</li><li>One can trust the Polkadot validator set that they are securing the chain</li><li>Interoperability &#8211; you can message between all the different <g class=\"gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"9\" data-gr-id=\"9\">parachains</g> /message passing/ async</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second part of the meetup, we deep dived into the code to discover the advantages of using Polakot and Substrate. For those of you who are new to Polkadot, Substrate is a framework allowing us to build entirely new blockchain only in few commands, stepping up on Polkadot&#8217;s development and helping us developers to focus on our business logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-721\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Substrate module example</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>During the code review, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/milen_radkov\">Milen</a> showed us how quick it is to run a custom <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">parachain</g> with a simple betting game ruining on it.

But before we continue, let&#8217;s first recap what topics we have covered till now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the previous posts, we have viewed briefly what is blockchain (from an oversimplified nontechnical perspective) and how your business can profit from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first post, we have discussed the benefits of integrating blockchain to your business. If you have missed this one you can read it now to get familiar with the technological promises of the blockchain and to learn how it can help your business grow. What is blockchain? Is it suitable for your business needs? What problems it solves, and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\">how to boost your business with blockchain?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our second post from this series, we spoke about the ways to finance your business idea or existing business through ICO or STO. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are unfamiliar with the difference between ICO and STO you can view the previous article here, <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain-part-2/\">boost your business with blockchain</a>.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aim of this post is to help you define the steps you have to take to bring your idea to life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assuming that you already understand what blockchain is and you can make difference between ICO and STO. You are now confident that blockchain can help you realize your idea and you have decided to make a coin offering.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The typical development of a project is having the following milestones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Putting the idea into a business plan</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*YgQytt2o4W0kCQa6\" alt=\"business plan\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@nikarthur?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Nik MacMillan</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Although some successful entrepreneurs claim that they managed to develop their business without a business plan, in most cases, you will need one. The business plan will give you directions and will help you to visualize all details related to making your idea a successful business. It will help you organize yourself,  define your revenue streams, your competitors and your weaknesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Writing a White Paper</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“A white paper is an informational document, issued by a company or not-for-profit organization, to promote or highlight the features of a solution, product, or service. White papers are sales and marketing documents, used to entice or persuade potential customers to learn more about or purchase a particular product, service, technology or methodology. White papers are designed to be used as a marketing tool before a sale, and not as a user manual or other technical document developed to provide support to the user after making a purchase.” </em></p><cite>Investopedia &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/whitepaper.asp\">whitepaper</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Building a website to show your idea to the world</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*InoqV-4tFJnwMQJY\" alt=\"building website\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@halgatewood?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hal Gatewood</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say how important is your online presence. If your aim is a global market than you have to have a global presence. A company website is your first step towards it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Starting an international marketing campaign</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your campaign should be ready to launch ideally 2-3 months before the coin offering. If you don&#8217;t have a marketing guru <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">in</g> your team, I recommend you to hire a specialized agency. Besides a solid idea and a good team, a key factor to your success is your marketing action plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Building the token</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Q1aDk0gp1pEtXY5A\" alt=\"smart contact development\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jefflssantos?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Jefferson Santos</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The step of building your digital asset /token/ actually consists of several others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you need to develop, secure and publish the crowdfunding smart contracts for your token sale event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second &#8211; something that will ease your future investors&#8217; experience and showcase your professionalism is an investor&#8217;s dashboard &#8211; a dedicated web-app where investors can easily contribute to your campaign. It is also the place where you will be conducting your KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti-money laundering) verifications in order for your project to fit the regulatory framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not a technical guy make sure that your project development is in good hands and you have everything ready prior to the launch of the coin offering. Small mistakes in your code can cost you millions, so leave time for an independent company to make a security audit to your smart contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Conducting the coin offering</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*PQmijCguucSiTT8t\" alt=\"launch your coin offering\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kydroon?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Kurt Cotoaga</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A few things can happen that can disturb your token sale event. Hackers and fraudsters are constantly sniffing around the space and are figuring out some clever tricks. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>For example, one hacker changed the target Ethereum address during the  CoinDash token sale and stole $7 million worth of Ethereum overnight. </p><p>This sort of behavior is happening almost daily — hackers or con artists  pop up in Slack telling users that token sale sites have changed and pump-and-dumpers post fake claims on social networks to help move the  price. </p><cite>TechCrunch</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In this step is very important that you are in continuous communication with your community and potential <g class=\"gr_ gr_222 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"222\" data-gr-id=\"222\">investors,</g> so that they <g class=\"gr_ gr_228 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"228\" data-gr-id=\"228\">dont</g> get tricked and lose money.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Developing the product</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qlPODU42HKOsmkzw\" alt=\"tools\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@hnhmarketing?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Hunter Haley</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After a successful campaign, the real work begins. Start allocating the funds and push the progress of the project. The project development itself should be divided into milestones including past achievements to give a clear picture of your progress to the investors. Your timeline should include what has been done, what are you doing now and what are you going to do in the next quarter, in the next years.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the 7 steps to be taken to lead the project to success. Their order should be respected and none of them can be neglected. Each step has its own budget and most of the times is conducted by a separate team/company. ex Marketing, Legal, Development etc. The most costly will be the marketing if the goal is a global reach. Second, depending on the nature of the cryptocurrency (if you choose a STO) could be the legal part which will depend not only on local jurisdiction but also on the jurisdiction of the investor&#8217;s country. The third will be the development of the cryptocurrency and all related builds around its launch (website, investor’s dashboard etc).</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great idea — but you are not a blockchain expert, Get in touch with us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full list of our services could be found on our website at <a href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://hack.bg/#services</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We<em> bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>How to determine and what are the milestones?

The peak was sometime in the middle of last year with projects like Tezos and FileCoin raising as much as 250 millions of dollars from individual investors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*li78tZhCpfoqOgA8\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@blankerwahnsinn?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fabian Blank</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though many of the projects failed to deliver the expected products, either due to lack of technology developments (the main issue being scalability) or by simply disappearing with bags full of money (a.k.a.

But what is STO?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>STO stands for Security Token Offering and the main difference to the ICO is that the tokens are <strong>Security Tokens</strong>, backed by something tangible like the assets, profits, or revenue of the company. To put it in another way, only accredited investors can participate in the offerings. Their funds are protected by the law and the investors are getting either a part of the company (shares) or part of the company&#8217;s profits (dividends).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*pFPj1Nd3IiOr7E2G\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rawpixel</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Securities laws are well developed and defined in most of <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">the countries</g>.
