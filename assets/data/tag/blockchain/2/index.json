In this article, we are going to explore the benefits of blockchain technology in the gaming industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gaming in numbers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As per recent reports, the gaming market currently represents the largest segment of the global digital content industry (bigger than movie and music industries combined), generating billions of dollars in revenues annually and attracting an extremely wide audience. Gaming is also considered to be one of the business areas in which blockchain technology is being implemented most rapidly.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report.png\" alt=\"2018 Global Game Market - Per device &amp; segment with year-on-year growth rates\" class=\"wp-image-1346\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report.png 782w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report-300x267.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report-768x685.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report-646x576.png 646w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px\" /><figcaption>Infographics: © hack | Data: Global Game Market Report from newzoo</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a Newzoo report, global gaming revenues for 2018 were around $134.9 billion, 10.9% more than for 2017. Just to put it in perspective, digital distribution channels (marketplaces) account for most of these revenues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that mobile games are a primer and act as the key growth driver in the gaming industry, with a projected growth rate of 12.8% for 2018, taking that segment to $63.2 billion. At the same time, the forecast for overall retail sales of games is only $12.4 billion, or 9% of the whole industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blockchain application in Gaming Industry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p> The intersection of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and gaming is presenting real growth potential for both blockchain and gaming.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-1024x388.png\" alt=\"Blockchain application in Games\" class=\"wp-image-1351\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-1024x388.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-300x114.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-768x291.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-1038x394.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Blockchain application in Games</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Background</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The game that marks the beginning of the blockchain gaming is <a href=\"https://huntercoin.org/\">HunterCoin</a>.  Released in February 2014 as a live experimental test to see how blockchain technology could handle full on game worlds. The purpose of the game was to collect HUC coins, human mining, but due to its fame, when the number of players grew the blockchain started to experience processing and speed issues.  This is mainly due to the fact that the game was running on a bitcoin fork (not suitable for applications that need to scale). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017 was released one of the most famous blockchain games build on Ethereum, CryptoKitties. In short, it is a game of digital collectibles allowing the player to collect (buy), breed and sell different (unique) types of virtual cats.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto-kitties.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1360\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto-kitties.jpg 620w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto-kitties-300x165.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /><figcaption>Crypto Kitties</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Marketplaces</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Games and game items are available at marketplaces. Currently, there are both types of marketplaces, centralized and decentralized. What are the limitation and the advantages of using any of those?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The context</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The world’s largest centralized marketplace for virtual goods (OPSkins), is having millions of users, billions of items listed, and trading volumes estimated to be over $46 billion. The platform job is to maintain the transactional trust between the users and to prevent fraud by maintaining huge personnel to ensure the smooth running of the platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how good the service of a centralized platform (marketplace) is, centralized platforms are limiting users on the way the platform can be used and on the way they transact with each other. Settlements cost them high fees and the transfers are taking a long time to execute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a decentralized marketplace, problems like fraud, transactional settlement, and international payments transactions are handled via smart contract ensuring cheap, fast, secure and transparent service.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the other hand, decentralized platforms can use smart contracts to allows the facilitation and enforcement of a virtual asset transaction that guarantees the fulfillment of an operation (buy/sell) without requiring the interference of a centralized party, ensuring the correctness of the transaction (regardless whether it is an item or a monetary value).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies-1024x576.png\" alt=\"CryptoZombies - blockchain based game\" class=\"wp-image-1354\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies.png 1031w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>CryptoZombies &#8211; blockchain based game</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Asset transfers</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"5d3b\">Multiplayer Games Have LOTS of&nbsp;Items</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Runescape has 35,000 and World of Warcraft, the king of MMOs has over 100,000 different items! Shooters like Overwatch and Team Fortress 2 each have thousands of skins and items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tokenization</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most exciting aspect of decentralized virtual goods exchanges is the ability to tokenize virtual goods. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we can see in the above example there are thousands of game items that can be tokenized and traded. But when a player dedicates of his time and money to play a game (develop a hero) he is left with nothing when he deletes the game as all of the information about his game was stored on the company&#8217;s servers.  Now with blockchain, the player can not only claim and keep his virtual assets but he can also transfer/sell it to other players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of  game assets hosted on the blockchain is that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> Transactions and their history is easy to track (transparency)</li><li>No one can steal your asset, as long as you keep your privet key secure </li><li>Assets can be traded without the need for intermediary service</li><li>Assets can be easily transferred from one gamer to another. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Better security, as well as new opportunities and incentives for gamers, are just some of the benefits that blockchain can bring to our virtual pastimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a 50+ billion virtual goods market, we believe that this is extra motivation for players to claim control and ownership of their virtual goods. This could result in motivation increase, hence more user engagement and more revenues for the game development companies.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>In game purchases</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another evident application of blockchain in games is the integration of cryptocurrencies that can be used for in-game purchases. Global in-game spending is expected to reach 32 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, up from 22 billion U.S. dollars in 2015.                         </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this sense, cryptocurrencies can be used as a link between the internal economy of the game and that of the real world. They can be transferred and traded for other cryptocurrencies or fiat money via build-in decentralized exchanges or even centralized party exchanges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, using blockchain in game development can help create more unique objects and artifacts making them more valuable and more desirable. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Building trust</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past couple of years, games have begun to use blockchain features such as wallets and tokens to secure ownership of game artifacts. Blockchain can also ensure the authenticity of an asset with its inbuild trust and transparency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the other hand, players looking to buy a virtual item can be sure about its authenticity because the items are recorded on the blockchain, further developing trust between buyers and sellers and thus stimulating more transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, we can say that blockchain-based, open-source, decentralized systems will make the gaming experience more secure and transparent, guaranteeing fair conditions for all members. The decentralized gaming platform is bringing in technologies that will ensure user satisfaction, add value to virtual assets, and probably expand the size of the virtual gaming market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great idea — but you don’t have the skill to build it – get in touch with us at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the full list of our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>We bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In previous articles, we have discussed the fundamentals of blockchain technology.

Additionally, it is immutable and transparent. In some of our previous articles, we have looked in details into the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\">tech behind and the idea of blockchain</a>. Following the series of blockchain&#8217;s best use cases and disrupting industries with blockchain technology in this next article, we are going to explore how the healthcare sector can benefit from integrating blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Healthcare in numbers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthcare is a complex ecosystem composed of <em>Drug manufacturers</em>, <em>Medical equipment makers, Managed healthcare companies</em> providing health insurance policies and <em>Healthcare facility firms</em> operating hospitals, clinics, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Global spendings in healthcare all sectors combined:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2015 Global healthcare spending topping $7 trillion dollars</li><li>Expected to grow to over $8.734 trillion by 2020 and to over $10 trillion by 2025 </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> According to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bisresearch.com/industry-report/global-blockchain-in-healthcare-market-2025.html\">report by BIS research.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> &#8220;A global blockchain in the healthcare market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 63.85% from 2018 to 2025, to reach a value of $5.61 billion by 2025. The use of blockchain for healthcare data exchange will contribute the largest market share throughout the forecast period, reaching a value of $1.89 billion by 2025, owing to the use of blockchain to solve the most widespread problem in healthcare information systems related to interoperability and non-standardization that has created data silos in the industry.<em>”</em> </p><cite>* CAGR ( Compound Annual Growth Rate)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the current problems in the Healthcare sector?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4>Non-startartisation</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Data is the next big thing that is going to revolutionize public healthcare and more specifically how the data is recorded, stored, analyzed and shared. But the current systems, if existing, are inefficient because they are centralized (all information kept in one place), siloed and disjointed. Moreover, they are inefficient because they are not allowing for easy sharing of patients data outside of the host institution without exposing the data at a security risk. In addition, health data is hard to make sense of as it&#8217;s often times presented in different formats, according to industry experts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"mce_47\">Interoperability</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another problem putting patients health at risk caused by healthcare systems is the <em><strong>interoperability</strong></em> issue:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <strong>“Statistics show that up to one in five patient records are not accurately matched even within the same health care system. As many as half of the patient records are mismatched when data is transferred between healthcare systems.”</strong><br></p><cite> <br>Director of Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI), Shaun Grannis </cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>Data ownership and control</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Today patients information is not in their control.  This might have been accepted up until now but in the future patients might claim their right to have access to their personal information and to control it. At the current setting, their information is gathered and managed by their host institution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> Drug traceability</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Drug counterfeiting is a major problem in the pharmaceutical industry. According to the Health Research Funding Organisation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>10% to 30% of the drugs sold in developing countries are counterfeit</li><li>The counterfeit drug market is worth $200 billion annually</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> From a more economic perspective, drug counterfeiting represents an annual loss of 10,2 billion euros (11,23 billion USD) for the European pharmaceutical sector and 37.700 jobs are lost because manufacturers employ fewer people than they would if fake drugs didn’t exist. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How blockchain can solve those problems?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is still a developing technology but we can already see the huge impact that it has in various sectors and industries like <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\">Finance </a>and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\">Supply Chain</a>. Healthcare is just another example where we can see its implication:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <strong>The</strong>&nbsp;<strong>adoption of the blockchain technology could save the healthcare industry up to $100-$150 billion per year by 2025</strong>&nbsp;in data breach-related costs, IT costs, operations costs, support function costs and personnel costs, and through a reduction in frauds and counterfeit products. </p><cite>BIS report</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>According to pharma executives technologies are the one that are going to have the biggest impact on the industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-1024x554.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1211\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-1024x554.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-300x162.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-768x415.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-1038x562.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech.png 1244w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In its core blockchain is <strong>immutable</strong>, <strong>search-ready</strong> (big data and analytics), <strong>cryptographically protected</strong> (cybersecurity) and <strong>distributed system</strong> (cloud-like service). This is why blockchain is the perfect all-in-one solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new generation of blockchains is solving the<strong> standardization and interoperability </strong>issues by design.

With the help of a smart contract (programable agreement), the patient can manage his data ( identifiable and non-identifiable) and share whatever he likes to share with whomever he likes to share it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recently written article, we have discussed the potential<a href=\"http://Blockchain can eliminate those risks by allowing end users to track each item origin with the help of IoT sensors.\"> </a><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\">use of blockchain in Supply Chain</a> and addressed the issue of <strong><em>drug traceability.</em> </strong>In short, we are reducing the possibility to buy a counterfeit drug by tracking the item with the help of IoT sensors and blockchain from the producer&#8217;s factory to our door. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the above mentioned problems, blockchain can also help the healthcare with payments and help to speed the verification of patient&#8217;s healthcare plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;<strong>Blockchain will become the next big healthcare technology innovation,</strong> particularly as it relates to payments and payer contracts.

We do business with companies and people who we don&#8217;t know.  We have to rely on 3rd party auditors and assessors to make sure that the products, materials or ingredients we are buying are really what they are supposed to be. This is a very expensive process which is done normally in a non-digitalised way.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the other hand, small companies are having a hard time to get into the market due to the lack of trust.  <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the above-mentioned problems( global scale, trust, and transparency), we are able to identify other key problems like <strong><em>ineffective </em></strong><em><strong>risk management, lack of end-to-end visibility and obsolescence of technologies</strong></em>. All impacting negatively companies ROI. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Risk management</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the supply chain management tool is not having access to key data from the value chain the companies fail to make accurate risk predictions that lead to higher risk exposures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lack of end-to-end visibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>End-to-end visibility is key to ROI (return on investment). The inadequate supply chain visibility is leading to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Increased inventory costs resulting from inventory build-ups</li><li>Increased freight costs from premium shipping </li><li>Decreased productivity resulting from manually intensive processes</li><li>Poor customer experience</li><li>Loss of revenue from product shortages</li><li>Delayed cash flow</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Obsolescence of technologies</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using old, inefficient and closed (centralized) technologies is damaging companies <em><strong>ROI</strong></em>, partners <em><strong>trust </strong></em>and customers <em><strong>satisfaction</strong></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that there is a solution to all those problems and it is called blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> Blockchain has the potential to become the universal supply chain operating system – increasing security, improving transparency and creating scalability. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why is blockchain perfect solution to tackle the existing problems of the Supply Chain?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In another series, we have already discussed <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\">what is blockchain</a> and how you can use the technology behind Bitcoin and Ethereum to help your business grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, blockchain is a digital ledger technology used to record transactions in chronological order. One can only add new transactions (not remove or edit), thus the ledger is immutable. Its underlying technology is offering us<em><strong> trust, transparency, and traceability</strong></em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we are going to look into its direct implementation in Supply Chain and learn why it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <em>Today’s supply chains are inherently complex- many lacking transparency due to lack of interoperability and inconsistent or unavailable data – areas where blockchain can counter these inefficiencies and add new value.</em><br></p><cite> <br><a href=\"https://www.blockchain-supplychain.com/\">https://www.blockchain-supplychain.com/</a> </cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The supply chain holds tremendous interest in the blockchain. The technology will be most useful in areas such as <em><strong>supplier payments, product traceability, and contract bids and execution</strong></em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us look at them one by one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Supplier Payments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The area where blockchain is mostly used as of today is the area of <strong>secure, fast and transparent</strong> transactions. Compared to traditional bank wire transfer the <em>cost </em>and <i>speed</i> of blockchain transaction are hundred if not thousandfold faster and cheaper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why blockchain transactions are a perfect way to pay your suppliers.  Even on the other side of the world, they will get their money just in a few seconds (depending on the currency ). <em><strong>Fast</strong></em> settlements are crucial for suppliers giving them more access to capital, thus more opportunities to do business. If you are not the supplier but the business owner instead, you can benefit by saving from the <em><strong>cost</strong></em> of the transactions. That could be a real deal when dealing with large amounts of money.  In addition to fast and cheap, transactions are can be used to for company&#8217;s accounting and auditing. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> Blockchain can fundamentally transform businesses by eliminating inefficiencies, speeding up transactions and enabling innovative new business models,” said IBM Research China director Dr. Xiaowei Shen.&nbsp;  </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Product Traceability</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key feature of the blockchain is the ability to track the products from the manufacturer/producer site to the point of sale, thus allowing the customer to check product origin and related details before buying it. This is an invaluable feature allowing each part of the value chain to track the product from raw material provider to the customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain&#8217;s ability to enable end-to-end visibility in Supply Chain can help companies grow their ROI. According to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3790363\">Gartner Research</a>, the quantitative benefits of implementing end-to-end visibility are phenomenal:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>20% in inventory savings </li><li>25% of increased regional forecast accuracy</li><li>98% of improved service level agreements</li><li>10% reduction of workforce</li><li>30% decrease in inventory stock </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take the car industry as an example to picture the complexity of the value chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-1024x640.png\" alt=\"Supply Chain value chain in car manufacturing industry\" class=\"wp-image-1140\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-1024x640.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-300x188.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-768x480.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-922x576.png 922w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Supply Chain value chain in car manufacturing industry</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Another use case to showcase the importance of <em>traceability </em>is the food/pharma industry where both <strong>producer </strong>and <strong>customer </strong>need to make sure that the product is not a counterfeit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Producers can protect their image and market by making sure that no counterfeit products have been infiltrated into their supply chain. Low-quality counterfeit products will not only reduce the company&#8217;s market share but can also lead to brand detriment when customers buy fake products with inferior quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For customers, quality can also mean health risks when we speak about alimentary products and pharma.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Implications of food safety and pharma</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>With growing global supply chains, food safety is a top concern with both consumers and regulators. The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/foodborne-disease-estimates/en/\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;(WHO) estimates that 420,000 people die annually from food contamination, which affects one in 10 people worldwide. Children under age five are at the highest risk with 125,000 children dying every year from foodborne illness, according to WHO. </p><cite><br></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The World Health Organization pegged global fake drug sales at $75bn in 2010, a 90% increase over five years. The issue of counterfeit medicines has become increasingly pressing, both in terms of the economic cost of this global black market and the risk to human life that comes from taking counterfeit drugs that may not have the same active pharmaceutical ingredients or dosage levels.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain can eliminate those risks by allowing end users to track each item origin with the help of IoT sensors. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3> Helping the small </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond product integrity and anti-counterfeiting efforts, blockchain could also play a role in overcoming the financial challenges faced by smaller operators along the supply chain.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In China, for example, pharma retailers – which often have to wait two to three months to receive payment for delivered medicines – have experienced problems accessing financing without proper credit records and collateral, which the transparency of blockchain could provide. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Contract bid and execution</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the process of buying is automated via <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contract</a> all parties can verify it. The smart contract enables trustless trade between absolute strangers, with the capability to introduce rules for trades that are at all stages transparent and self-enforcing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Data and Governance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, besides bringing more trust the blockchain systems are also a good source of data collection because of their transparency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, their immutable nature is guaranteeing better data quality. Thus, allowing companies to better manage their supply chain and to optimize their processes. This in return is helping them stay ahead of the competition, win bigger market share and make more profits. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the next article about <a href=\"https://hack.bg/category/blog/blockchain-and-business/\">Blockchain and Business</a> directly in your inbox subscribe to our newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great idea — but you don’t have the skill to build it – get in touch with us at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the full list of our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>We bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain’s Best Use Case Series Inspired by a recent event, the Dronathon that we have co-organized with Premium CoWorking Space in Sofia we decided to shed some light on the role of blockchain in Supply Chain.

The sale is administered by the exchange, on behalf of the team.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>IEOs are getting more and more attention, both from business teams and investors. <em>But are they really the right solution for you to finance your business idea?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To spice-up this articles we reached out to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelovstoyan/\">Stoyan Angelov</a> CEO and Founder of <a href=\"https://www.evedo.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evedo</a> (currently running an IEO) to share his experience with us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s put the appearance of the IEO&#8217;s in perspective. Before the rise of the IEO model in the blockchain space, we had witnessed the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/ico-initial-coin-offering/\">ICO</a> and STO models. We have discussed their <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/news/initial-exchange-offering-ieo-pros-and-cons/\">advantages and disadvantages</a> in previous <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain-part-2/\">blockchain and business</a> articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, mostly due to scammy projects investors lost <strong>trust</strong> and as we all know when there is no trust there is no business. But the appearance of the IEO&#8217;s seems to have solved the trust issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We can speculate that from an investor&#8217;s perspective one feels more secure when investing in a project listed on his favorite exchange. This means that by accepting to run an IEO the exchanges are putting their <em>reputation</em> at stake. Let me put this in another way. Investors <strong>trust</strong> projects because they trust the exchanges that they are running on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Stoyan, Why did choose to run an IEO?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It has been more than 1 year since we started our work on Evedo. Our team has started talking about the possibility of launching an Initial Exchange Offering for quite some time. It was our trip and remote work from Thailand that made a significant change in the way we structure our fundraising model. We received a lot of advisory on the IEO part.<br> Actually, I think that the new wave of fundraising through exchange token sales is really valuable for all the parties involved. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>You as a business owner need the people to trust you so they can invest in your idea and help you develop it. So by running your IEO on a platform that is trusted, you are increasing your chances to attract more investors, thus more funds for your idea. But running your crowdfunding campaign on an exchange is having its pros and cons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to be overhyped. IEOs are not only bringing us positives, but there are also some negatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What are the CONs?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>COST / CONTROL / REACH</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As we mentioned above, if you decide to use the IEO model you are going to benefit from the exchange&#8217;s reputation, but that comes at a price. So the first thing is the <strong>cost</strong>. Be prepared to spend some money upfront in order to be able to make your campaign on a specific exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running your campaign on an exchange is going to save you time and will help you mitigate some security risks but since you do not have the private keys to your wallet you are giving up the <strong>control </strong>over your funds and tokens. Can you trust the exchange?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And third, by deciding to go with one exchange you automatically exclude all other exchanges, thus you limit your <b>reach </b>of investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What are the PROs?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>REPUTATION / LIQUIDITY / SECURITY</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fist, as we have already said, one of the main advantages to run your crowdfunding campaign on a certain exchange is its <strong>reputation</strong>. Moreover, all current customers of the exchange are becoming your potential customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, not neglectable from both investor&#8217;s and business owner&#8217;s perspective benefit is the <strong>liquidity</strong> of the token at the end of the token sale. The more liquidity &#8211; the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And last, running your campaign on an exchange can help you with reducing some <strong>security</strong> risks.  Allowing the investors to purchase the tokens on exchange as opposed to sending smart contract addresses where they have to send their tokens is lowering the risk of phishing attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What did you get from working with an exchange?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked Stoyan, and this is what he answered:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>At the current market situation, an Initial Exchange Offering simply makes sense. IEO adds some protection for the investors who participate, as the token is already listed on an exchange and the exchange is somehow the middleman who ensures credibility and trust.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Most of the exchanges do heavy due diligence on the projects before they even consider their application for IEO. This is exactly what happened to us! We waited more than 3 weeks just for the internal teams of BitForex to do due diligence on our papers, company incorporation, team, token, token economics, business model, etc. Right after that our application was processed and we started structuring when and how we are going to make it. We can say that projects that issue an IEO have increased credibility, because of the Exchange that has their backs, so to say.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We believe the IEO model assures fewer scams. When we think of the ICO wave from 2017 and 2018 we normally recall all the projects that were somehow fraudulent which led to a certain disappointment in the blockchain field in general.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>For Evedo, IEO is an interesting opportunity for two main reasons. First of all, it is a way to raise funding for further product development without the traditional VC investment model. Secondly, it is also a fruitful opportunity as a Marketing strategy and spreading the word about what we are trying to build in markets, networks, and communities who are quite different.<br></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>How did you choose your exchange?</h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was introduced to the BitForex team during the year&#8217;s TokenomX in Bangkok. We got along really well. We set up a call, and me, as well as Elena (CMO of Evedo) got a really long discussion with them. We were currently speaking with a few other exchanges at the time but we chose BitForex as we trusted their professional approach and interesting markets that they operate on.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>In your opinion, are IEOs really worth the hype?</h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We think the IEOs really worth the hype. As I mentioned in my previous answer projects that issue an IEO have increased credibility, because of the Exchange. It’s a better way to reach out to new communities, new markets. It’s an interesting opportunity now and we are happy to be a part of it.<br></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the alternatives to raise funds?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the traditional well-known ways to raise funds and the above mentioned ICO, STO and IEO there are also a bunch of other alternatives. All of them rely on code rather than on a centralized authority. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first worth mentioning is the DAICO. It&#8217;s a mix of DAO and ICO. The DAICO model was proposed by Vitalik Buterin, father of Ethereum, a few years ago. It is a fair model giving more power and control in the investor&#8217;s hands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one is the TTO (trusted token offering) using a smart contract middle layer that is distributing the funds to the developers only according to achieved milestones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And last, another decentralized solution that is allowing us to create cool token models are bonding curves. Without getting into technical details we can say that bonding curves are a great way to provide instant liquidity and a continuous funding model. An example of a project using bonding curves during a token sale was Bancor, helping them to raise over 140 million USD in just over 8 hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to expect next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As IEO was an alternative to ICO and STO, we can expect to see in the near future the appearance of new funding models, providing investors with more control and more security. In my opinion that can be in the form of DIEO (decentralized initial exchange offering), which will combine the pros of IEO and the pros of the decentralized models that we have discussed above.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great idea — but you don’t have the skill to build it – get in touch with us at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the full list of our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>We bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>What is IEO?

But to have access to the financial system as a business owner up until now one needed to have an intermediary in the process. Most of the times those are the banks as well as other services providers cutting on your profits or increasing the price for the end user of your products. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Be your own bank</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With blockchain, you are your own bank. You can create your own account and operate it the way you want.  As long as you manage to keep your private keys safe you are safe. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-991\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1.png 943w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1-300x138.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/1-768x354.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px\" /><figcaption>Source: <a href=\"https://advisory.kpmg.us/content/dam/advisory/en/pdfs/blockchain-future-finance.pdf\">https://advisory.kpmg.us/content/dam/advisory/en/pdfs/blockchain-future-finance.pdf</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>But what exactly are the benefits for business owners to be their own bank?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Full Control</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, you have full control and full access to your funds. 24/7 365 days a year. No need to wait days for a payment to settle. When your customers pay you in crypto (ETH/BTC) you will have your money within a few seconds/minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Save Money</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, if you use crypto payments to purchase your stock you can save a lot of money on bank transfers. And third, since crypto payments are all recorded to the blockchain, you can use the records when doing your accounting, thus again you will save time and money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Automate</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to payments and money transfers, the blockchain is allowing business owners to run businesses in automated ways using smart contracts.

Thanks to all the people that came and our awesome guest <strong>Rali Ralev</strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://weidex.market\">WeiDex</a></strong> we had not only learned cool stuff about Tron but also have had a lot of fun. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was by far the funniest and maybe most interactive meetup that we have ever had. I encourage you, future guest and speakers, to be more involved in the meetups, as they are not ours but yours 🙂 </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to fill these community events with moments of sharing and learning but also make them cozy and fun. At the end of the day, we are all in the same boat, struggling with the same problems and fighting the same monsters 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let me tell you what have you missed beside the fun if you did not manage to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blockchain Developers News Digest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the first part we had our CEO <strong><a href=\"http://twitter.com/milen_radkov\">Milen Radkov</a> </strong>made a quick tour of relevant developers news. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milen started with a last minute call to all teams to update their <a href=\"http://infura.io\">Infura</a> legacy keys before they die on the 27th of March. It turned out to be a useful warning as some devs have missed this incoming major update. Along with the legacy keys, Infura users will benefit after the update from new API Security section that could be found in the dashboard. Infura is also promising premium services coming up soon after the update. So stay tuned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, we learned about <strong>Embark 4.0</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you unfamiliar with what Embark is :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Framework by Status</li><li>Out of beta and ready for developers</li><li>Including Cockpit – An intuitive Web Interface<ul><li><strong>Dashboard</strong> &#8211; provides an overview of all processes controlled by Embark (interact with Ethereum, IPFS, ENS, Whisper)</li><li><strong>Blockchain explorer</strong></li><li><strong>Iterative Deployer &#8211; </strong>enables selective deployment of smart contracts to any network</li><li><strong>Code editor &#8211; </strong>contracts even get redeployed as changes are saved</li></ul></li><li>Integrated debugger &#8211; easy way to debug contracts by displaying solidity source codes lines where a transaction failed</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> Milen shared with us the novelties in Truffle v5.0.9 including new multi-chain infrastructure that enables basic Quorum support and debugger improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did not miss to mention about the <strong>Ganache v2.0 &#8211; Chocolate Birthday Cake 🎂    </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>bringing in:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>New features<ul><li><strong>Workspaces &#8211; </strong>save your development blockchains in workspaces</li><li><strong>Contract State Decoding</strong></li><li><strong>Event Decoding &#8211; </strong>events that have fired during this chain&#8217;s life</li></ul></li><li>New options<ul><li><strong>Hardfork-</strong> option to change the hardfork. Possible options are: Petersburg, Constantinople, and Byzantium.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Another worth mentioning news was the release of Peter Tsankov’s team of ChainSecuriy &#8211; Soltix. Soltix is a scalable framework for automated testing of Solidity compilers allowing us to test Solidity compiler and EVM automatically. How cool is this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lastly Milen spoke about the shutting down of Mist and the release of the alpha version of the Playground &#8211; for generalized state channels built with the Counterfactual framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we proceed with <g class=\"gr_ gr_8 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"8\" data-gr-id=\"8\">Rali&#8217;s</g> presentation we took time to announce our recent <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/events/hack-partners-with-wearedevelopers/\">partnership with WeAreDevelopers</a> world congress and to share with the community the perks we get from it.  You can find out more information on how you can compete to win 2 tickets for <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">the Congress</g>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-892\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0350-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is where the fun starts. Rali has prepared to introduce us to the <a href=\"http://tron.network\">Tron network</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0357-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-891\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0357-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0357-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0357-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0357-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We looked at what is Tron and how the Tron protocol is working. Rali covered also the types of Nodes, the Governance mechanism, how one can write Tron Smart Contracts and Tools you can use to help you in your development process. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery aligncenter columns-2 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"894\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=894\" class=\"wp-image-894\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0362-1-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Rali Ralev, co-founder of WeiDex talking about Tron network</figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"895\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=895\" class=\"wp-image-895\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/DSC_0355-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Rali Ralev, co-founder of WeiDex talking about Tron network</figcaption></figure></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can watch the whole recording of the meetup here:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/whsSoP-_Ga8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Introduction to Tron &#8211; 0x08 [Blockchain Developers Meetup]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, Rali, and thanks to all of you who attended and to those of you who read this post till the end!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wEmk4bronJqNgst_d8BIXzE9Vig8JbUqRYIDDpEaxfA/edit?usp=sharing\">Milen&#8217;s presentation &#8211; blockchain developers news digest</a></li><li><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tbeJIu5yaK-9SEdZCv1EzAQBtAuXteui\">Rali&#8217;s presentation &#8211; Tron network</a></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Earlier this week we had our 8th Blockchain Developers Meetup.
