Trust and transparency remain a significant issue for some players, and for operators, the gaming experience is reliant on often centralized systems, that are themselves vulnerable to manipulation and hacking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where blockchain comes in!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantages of blockchain and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/smart-contracts-vs-traditional-contracts/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">smart contracts</a> can solve many issues regarding safety and fair game, as the technology allows to record anonymously user actions and game results; Faster transaction speed, because clients of blockchain-based resources can withdraw or deposit funds without waiting for several days; Anonymity, as blockchain-based crypto casinos guarantee that player personal information won’t be disseminated and more&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why does gambling need blockchain, and what are the advantages of the technology?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What benefits could blockchain offer the gambling industry?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology offers a number of unique advantages over other systems that make it such a perfect fit for gambling:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Transparency</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there’s the transparency angle. In blockchain systems, data is written automatically to a distributed ledger, which by definition provides an immutable, trusted source of truth. Blockchain gaming data can be relied upon by operators, players, and regulators, all of whom can access the same data in real-time which is helpful for resolving player trust issues and the disputes that inevitably arise along the way. But it’s also incredibly useful for operators meeting their compliance requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Security</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main opportunities blockchain provides is enhanced security. With data held on the blockchain theoretically unhackable and totally secure, information can, automatically, be considered no longer vulnerable to fraud. The decentralized nature of the technology ensures secure transactions as well as prevents data from being changed or deleted. So the history of victories and payments is not only open but also well-protected and immutable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Improved Payout Process</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As for payments, the process of withdrawal has always been a challenge. In order to get the money, one could face the necessity to deal with different documents and intermediaries as well as time delays.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology introduces smart contracts to the gambling industry. These are programs that perform certain actions (eg. money transfer) when the required conditions are met.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, blockchain technology allows faster transaction speed as payments are conducted directly, without third parties and there is no need for clients to wait several days to withdraw their money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, empowered by blockchain, the process of getting money becomes fast, cheap and simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Cryptocurrency Availability&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the public mind, blockchain has always been known for cryptocurrencies and in the case of gambling, it is an appropriate association. Implementation of crypto in the betting and gambling services can widen the audience and helps to get rid of third-party intermediaries like banks or payment services.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Audience Expansion</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>People related to the industry believe that blockchain will help to make gambling more socially acceptable and, as a result, attract more users to blockchain-based betting platforms and casinos. This is the effect of the benefits we mentioned above: security, cryptocurrency availability, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-1024x445.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2999\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-1024x445.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-300x130.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-768x334.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-1536x667.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-1038x451.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What challenges does the gambling industry face with blockchain?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, things like anonymity can be regarded as a two-edged sword. For example, the fact that transactions can’t be traced to the real user, if no KYC is required, opens the door to the very same criminal activity the industry is trying to prevent nowadays. While blockchain services are hailed for anonymity, this feature isn’t likely to sit well with regulations. How would anonymous gambling allow for effective age checks, anti-money laundering processes, and self-exclusion facilities? These questions are fair to ask and are not something the technology is not capable of solving &#8211; for example via Zero-Knowledge Proof based systems, which would allow the user to prove they are old enough to participate in the betting platform without revealing sensitive and/or private information to the whole world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people consider the investment in bitcoin as the same as gambling in a casino. However, while gambling on games like roulette often requires an understanding of roulette odds and strategy play successfully, a similarly considered approach to investing in cryptocurrency might be futile. This is due to its sheer volatility, which can drastically drop its value in a single day. The challenge &#8211; price volatility. All cryptocurrencies, with no exceptions, are prone to price change. The value of a single unit of currency changes on a day-to-day basis exactly because the blockchain is ungoverned and decentralized. This creates a feeling of insecurity in many users and casino players, thus making them reluctant to even get started with the technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The very nature of the technology allows players to improve the fairness and transparency of online gambling. However, the regulatory issues involved in introducing blockchain could prove to be the biggest stumbling block companies face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, some places are already starting to adopt laws that allow casinos and gambling operators to accept cryptocurrencies as legal tender. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gambling Commission has already accepted that cryptocurrencies can be used for gambling. This is because it’s classed as ‘money or money’s worth’ in the Gambling Act 2005. But it has expressed concerns about how well casinos will be able to put effective controls in place that manage the various risks involved with these cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If these regulatory challenges can be overcome, it’s highly likely we’ll witness blockchain being more regularly adopted to audit, monitor, and record different parts  – from the players and operators to the games themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the potential challenges and controversies involved, blockchain is an emerging technology that cannot be ignored, particularly in technology-based businesses like online casinos. Over the next ten years or so, experts predict that blockchain will transform almost every industry – including gambling, as blockchain allows gambling to rapidly advance and enter new levels of trust-based customer relations and guarantees fair gaming, which is quite important for the industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So stay tuned!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain is already shaping the future of many industries (for the better) and is set to be the next big [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"18","title":"Blockchain and Business","path":"/category/blockchain-and-business/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-04-02T12:06:04","id":"2954","title":"How Blockchain is taking over the world [2021]","path":"/blog/how-blockchain-is-taking-over-the-world-2021/","content":"\n<p>Blockchain technology has to be one of the biggest innovations of the past decade. Considering it’s something that began with mere cryptocurrency, now  – it has a ripple effect on several important sectors, from manufacturing, <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain-2/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">supply chain</a> to Fintech, <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-art/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Art</a>, and education.<br>Many predict it is going to transform the nature of transactions, trading across the world, as well as transform the way we manage data, both internally and externally between parties, and most importantly build trust, transparency and change our worldview. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what makes blockchain so attractive to businesses and different industries? How is still continuing to be so hyped and controversial? And most importantly, why are there so many applications being developed on the Blockchain?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is simple &#8211; It’s because of its benefits. Blockchain offers indisputable traceability, distributed collaboration capabilities, trust, and rapid updates to support managing data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend is evidenced by ever-growing global investment in blockchain solutions, which is forecast to reach US$15.9 billion in 2023, ten times more than the $1.5 billion invested in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Southeast Asia, businesses are feeling optimistic too, with 45% of companies believing that blockchain technology growth will accelerate with more applications and opportunities over the next three to five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let’s look at more recent events &#8211; <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/crypto\">PayPal’s adoption of Bitcoin</a> late last year is not only heralding mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies but of blockchain’s utility in an era in which remote collaboration is prized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year has been off to a notable start for crypto and blockchain. On Jan. 7 the total cryptocurrency market hit an all-time high exceeding $1 trillion for the first time. Renewed interest in and conversations around, blockchain technology and digital currencies from industry and government leaders have accompanied the rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s new is that blockchain interoperability has gotten better, the technology itself has matured, and vendors have significantly stepped up their efforts in this area, making it more accessible and ready to take over the world for good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we made a list of&nbsp; some trends blockchain is most likely to follow in 2021:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Supply Chain Optimization</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing supply chains is crucial especially in the area of goods flow and logistics as the industries are known for their paper-heavy processes and struggle with many challenges in day-to-day business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of international goods traffic, it is often a wide variety of systems, manual work, and cross-border specifications that make the work of logisticians and partners more difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimized supply chains do not just refer to the cost-optimized shipment of good or raw materials from A to B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long distances, many partners, large volumes of documents and data, and mutual trust can be optimally mapped digitally with blockchains and various applications. As a distributed ledger, the technology is ideally suited to managing large volumes of data raw materials that can be tracked from their origin and grant digital certificates the authenticity or accuracy of information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The integration of DLT in supply chain management is one of the top blockchain trends in 2021 because, on the one hand, the consumer’s need for transparency is growing and on the other hand, the barrier-free supply of goods across all borders ensures greater security, trust and economic stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DeFi Adoption</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/defi-decentralized-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) is experiencing a new wave of excitement and adoption since mid-December(2020) after the DeFi summer blossom. The value of DeFi tokens hit new highs, bolstering awareness of DeFi within the crypto community while <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/traditional-vs-decentralized-fundraising-models/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">attracting new users from traditional finance</a> (TraFi), enabling private small investors to enter the financial world, turning millions of people into investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Blockchain provides numerous approaches for DeFi adoption in different fields, ranging from trading, lending, derivatives, to the introduction of automated market makers. These clear winners of DeFi’s adoption have become prime targets for everyone who&#8217;s trying to take advantage of their innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Certificate verification via the blockchain</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The validity and timeliness of certificates are the basis for trust between business partners. Certificates using blockchain technology are tamper-proof and can be viewed transparently by every participant in the network. Providers of these solutions thus ensure that audits and certification, for example, can be carried out successfully. However, the digital certificates can also be proof of ownership or proof of origin. Once stored, anyone can access the relevant information with a QR code, ensuring efficient processes and user convenience during audits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital certificates are a blockchain trend 2021, as they prevent misuse and provide consumers and partners with security and trust for future business relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>DEXes (Decentralized Exchanges)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to exchanging crypto, many have long been focused on centralized players like Binance or Coinbase largely due to their fiat onramps and ease of use. Despite these notions, many have been quick to point out that centralized exchanges come with their own inherent risks – namely those of custody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Famously highlighted by hacks on once-prominent exchanges, many traders have come to recognize the value of non-custodial solutions offered by decentralized exchanges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past year alone, DEXs have made serious improvements in both usability and liquidity – signaling that they are ready to compete with their goliath counterparts. Here are some of the DEXes’s characteristics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Non-custodial</em> – Ownership of the underlying assets is never revoked.</li><li><em>Automated</em> – With no intermediaries, DEX trading is instantaneous so long as there is sufficient liquidity.</li><li><em>Cost-Efficient</em> – Many DEXs have minimal trading fees, allowing users to swap assets at little to no cost</li><li><em>Globally Accessible</em> – Most DEXs do not require any sign-ups, and largely come with no counterparty risk.</li><li><em>Intuitive</em> – Newer trends have evolved DEX trading from order books to simple point and click swaps.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>DEXes are definitely one of the blockchain trends in 2021, as the traffic and trading volume of existing providers is increasing month by month and people are starting to look for new options for trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>NFTs — Non-Fungible Tokens</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2965\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-Fungible Tokens are on the rise and quickly gaining popularity across games, art, and music digital asset exchanges, and blockchain platforms. NFTs enable digital scarcity, meaning a single copy of a unique digital asset can be stored within an NFT and can’t be replicated. NFTs were originally popularized by the game Crypto Kitties but since then many <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-nfts-in-art/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">digital art projects</a> and startups have established themselves in the NFTs world. In-game assets can be digitized and exchanged using NFTs, the same applies to music and audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital rights management is definitely another space which is set for disruption using non fungible tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tokenization of bonds — STOs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>STOs are a type of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_offering\" class=\"rank-math-link\">public offering</a> in which tokenized digital securities, known as security tokens, are sold in cryptocurrency exchanges, or security token exchanges. Tokens can be used to trade real financial assets such as equities and fixed income. After crypto-tokens, security tokens are something to look at in 2021 because they are fully regulated and represent digital assets that comply with securities regulators&#8217; basic regulations. The offerings are securities that have been approved by the authorities and are therefore also subject to the prospectus requirement, which must clearly state the funding objective. This is because they involve financing rounds in which equity or debt capital is to be generated. They may be carried out by any company that complies with securities regulations. STOs, give the buyers a share of the company’s profits in return for the loan they extend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to traditional investments, however, STOs offer significantly higher returns and interest rates, making them particularly attractive to investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The immense potential for the next few years is likely to lie in the fact that STOs do not require intermediaries&#8217; assistance. The much leaner structure, therefore, offers greater profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have recently emerged as a hot topic in the financial space. Banks, Institutions, and governments are performing research and analysis on the economic and technical feasibility of introducing a new form of digital money and its impact on monetary and fiscal policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Bank of International Settlements <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap107.htm\" class=\"rank-math-link\">report</a> states that over 80% of central banks are already researching CBDC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are even countries that experimenting with CBDCs.:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The People&#8217;s Bank of China is one of the first central banks to develop a CBDC. They deployed a special task force in 2014 to research and implement a digital Yuan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, the world&#8217;s oldest bank, Swedish Riksbank, began its CBDC project called e-krona. In 2019, the Bahamas also began their CBDC project called &#8220;Sand Dollar&#8221; — it was fully deployed in October 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, the Republic of the Marshall Islands shared plans for launching a CBDC called Sovereign (SOV).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are still many uncertainties concerning control, liquidity, and more, central bank money is definitely one of the Blockchain Trends in 2021 because it is only a matter of time before digital money becomes mass adoption.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the important trends one can watch out for in the coming years. From making a food supply chain safer and smarter to transforming legacy processes, blockchain leaders are leading the business world into a new era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The future of distributed ledger technology and blockchain is rapidly changing. Mainstream adoption of blockchain is surely coming and we will see continued interest from, both the consumer and enterprise levels around the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what happens in 2021,&nbsp; be sure to hold on tight because it is going to be a wild year and one for the books.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain technology has to be one of the biggest innovations of the past decade.

Basically, Cryptokitties was the first enormous boom of the craze for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long story short, in September 2020, Christie’s auction house announced the sale of a digital portrait of the Bitcoin code for more than $130,000. It was the first time a non-fungible token was auctioned at one of the major auction houses for traditional art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly we all started reading news about Grimes who <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56252738\" class=\"rank-math-link\">sold some of her digital art for more than $6m</a>&nbsp;or about <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Nyan Cat being sold as one</a>, or on March 11, 2021, the most expensive digital art sale was made &#8211; Christie&#8217;s sold their first digital work of art, Beeple&#8217;s <a href=\"https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924\" class=\"rank-math-link\">&#8220;EVERYDAY: THE FIRST 5000 DAYS&#8221;</a> for a whopping $69.3 million.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And by the time we all thought we sort of knew what the deal was, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables\">the founder of Twitter put an autographed tweet</a> up for sale as an NFT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve seen any of this news and still wondered, <em>okay so what even is an NFT?</em> here is an explanation we give:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What are NFTs?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>NFT stands for &#8220;non-fungible token.&#8221; We can explain this word by word.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, a “fungible” asset refers to something that is interchangeable with another unit of that same asset. A good example of a fungible asset is the US dollar. If I exchange my $1 bill for your $1 bill, nothing really changes. While they are two different pieces of fancy paper, both bills represent the same exact value. That’s fungibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, a “<em>non</em>-fungible” asset refers to something of a distinct value. There are no two exact same things. A good example of a non-fungible asset is the painting of the Mona Lisa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A “non-fungible <em>token”</em> is where things get really interesting. Here is where we bring on the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/blockchain-software-development/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">blockchain</a>. The first and so far most popular of these implementations is the creation and distribution of fungible and non-fungible tokens. A non-fungible token allows us to create a digital certificate that represents a unique asset. This allows us to create proofs of authenticity for digital content that can be owned, bought, sold and traded. Because these tokens are stored on an open and distributed blockchain (such as Ethereum), their embedded metadata and transaction history are completely verifiable by anyone in the world with an Internet connection. That means we can all know what digital wallets own what tokens at any given point in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can attach these tokens to pretty much anything, including digital files— a photo, a video, an audio recording, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The implications of NFTs are truly infinite, and we’ve just begun to scratch the surface of possibilities. So far, non-fungible tokens are being used to create industries around digital art, collectibles, gaming skins, digital land, and many many more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How are artists selling their work on the Blockchain?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And now as we have a clearer conception of what NFTs are, let us jump into the now-exploding world of NFTs and Art.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you have created some really cool digital sticker, or Photoshop picture, or meme (whatever is more convenient to you) and you upload it onto the Internet space. Boom, now everyone can drag it and download it, which automatically makes hundreds and thousands of copies of your artwork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is up until the advent of NFTs. This time, after creating your artwork, you <em>mint </em>it on the blockchain — a fancy way of saying that you turn it into an NFT. This process differs from site to site, but it can be done on platforms like <a href=\"https://niftygateway.com/become-creator\">Nifty Gateway</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now there is a one on one proof of authenticity certificate for your work that exists on the Ethereum blockchain, securely housed in your digital wallet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose to put it up for sale, and anyone can bid on it or buy it right away at a listed price.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>But what’s the point?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since this piece of art is created and exists on a screen (be it phone, computer, tablet, etc). It can still be seen, screen-shotted, dragged, downloaded, and shared by anyone online. So the initial reaction will be <em>“Why would anyone want to buy digital art if it still can be used and copied by many?”</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we suggest copying is good, sharing is great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take an example &#8211; The Scream is a masterpiece by the Norwegian artist Edvard Munch which everybody knows. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"680\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1500387364-1024x680.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2879\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1500387364-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1500387364-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1500387364-768x510.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1500387364-868x576.jpg 868w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/1500387364.jpg 1190w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>The Scream &#8211; Edvard Munch</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been turned into a meme, used and shared by many. The plan is &#8211; the more shares it has over the Internet the more this work of art’s cultural relevance continues to grow, and the more value the original painting has.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the basic idea is that your artwork can be screen-shot and used the same way The Scream can be photoed and used, but that does not mean one claims provenance. The deeper concept of NFT art is agreed-upon value and ownership; even if anyone can see,<em> </em>download, print out, and hang up a piece of digital art, only a select few can actually own that exact piece, and that ownership is recorded on a blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s key to know that when buying an NFT one gains the rights to the unique token, but only on the blockchain. So when you buy a piece of art, you own it on the blockchain, but you have no control over rights to its distribution. When you buy an NFT in most cases you&#8217;re not buying content, but rather a token that connects your name with the creator&#8217;s art on the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why buy NFTs?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As the NFT trend picks up steam, it&#8217;s also drawing in curious new buyers — people who never thought could afford a piece of art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing in art has traditionally been the reserve of the upper-classes who can afford to invest in something that is likely to lose value. Crypto art could provide a way for those with less capital to invest in works, financially supporting artists you like, gives you some basic usage rights, plus, you don&#8217;t have to think about where to put it when you buy it. 😀</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, fractionalizing is an increasingly popular way to buy art in recent years, as it allows owners to buy shares in the same piece. The same argument for NFTs being less risky also applies to why it could be ideal for tokenization. Through blockchain technology, fractionalization can actually be part of the digital artwork itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2920\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-1-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-1-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/4-1-1.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many questions are raised “Will NFTs end up being a passing fad?”; “Is it a bubble?” “Maybe a hype?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe all of them or maybe it&#8217;s the next big thing.

Gaming, Supply Chain Music, and Art were some of the industries that were covered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;NFTs have a lot of uncovered potentials.</p><p>It was very interesting to follow different art, designer and digital creators, starting to embrace NFTs as a new way to monetize their work as blockchain is becoming more accessible to a wider audience.”</p><cite>Milen</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We discussed the element of subjectivity in art and&nbsp; Who decides what is the value of an art piece that is an&nbsp; NFTs of some sort?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;Well, basically, market, just like in the regular space, if someone is willing to pay.</p><p> A banana taped to a wall for $120 000, if someone is willing to pay for that, then that is the price. The price covering the NFTs art is working with the same mechanism as the regular art only a bit fancier&#8221;.</p><cite>Luka</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the key moments were when discussing existential and pragmatic questions like how digital art is going to be presented to the world, how you will “hang it”&nbsp; and how the trend should be set.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re talking about virtual space where you hang it in the middle of your wallet, it&#8217;s because the first thing somebody does is check out your wallets. And to see what are you holding crypto, and also NFTs. So, it&#8217;s like, inviting people to your house to see your artwork, but in your wallet.” </p><cite>Luka</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Or just imagine some virtual museum tours around digital art emerging out of this non-fungible tokens hype. So I think this from one side, it&#8217;s too difficult to grasp from the traditional art that we&#8217;re used to seeing. But from other perspectives, it brings up a lot of new models that may emerge as businesses and as ways to communicate or to cherish or see art in general.” </p><cite>Milen</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest lies within your imagination 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We debated about what is behind the hype and why there is hype behind it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;And my opinion is that it represents a unique way of earning money for people who were basically, we have gatekeepers all around them, musicians, artists gaming, but anything that is expressive, which was unable to be directly monetized, and now it&#8217;s monetizable.”</p><cite>Luka</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>We concluded that every generation has something of its own. Now real artists have many new exchanges and platforms that are emerging that are allowing them to create or trade or invest in portfolios. Now, after several years of development, the user interfaces and the whole user journey and flow are smoother than it was once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But still,  there is a lot more to go. And we think that&#8217;s also a topic to be brought up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this the optimal way to use NFTs? Or should it be more simple for people or users or regular non-tech people? For example, someone that is not technically advanced? Why shouldn&#8217;t they use NFT&#8217;s in digital arts or digital collectibles of some sort? And what is the next big thing for NFTs?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those and more questions were on the agenda for our first hackCast. But we want to hear your opinion on the topic as well.&nbsp;Comment below or contact if you have some interesting idea you want to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We thank our first guests Milen and Luka for the interesting conversation and the friendly and congenial atmosphere they created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are looking forward to the next hackCast!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Hey guys, yesterday (Mar 1) our first hackCast took place on the Clubhouse app.&nbsp; For the first topic we selected [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"9","title":"Blog","path":"/category/blog/"},{"id":"5","title":"Events","path":"/category/events/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-02-25T10:00:00","id":"2649","title":"Let&#8217;s talk blockchain &#8211; Vladislav Dramaliev [Part 2]","path":"/blog/lets-talk-blockchain-vladislav-dramaliev-part-2/","content":"\n<p>In Part 1 of our interview with Vlad, we talked about Blockchain and DeFi projects, the current bull-run, and more. If you have missed it you can check it <strong><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/lets-talk-blockchain/lets-talk-blockchain-vladislav-dramaliev-part-1/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Part 2 we are going to discuss the need for crypto in the world; the need for regulations; decentralization, Eth2.0, and more just keep reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Why do you think the world needs crypto? Or why not?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The world definitely needs crypto! One of the reasons is the fact that it provides an alternative to the current financial and banking system. It&#8217;s very early to determine if this alternative is successful, but so far, is doing quite well. I think crypto is changing the way people think about money, and what money is, what value is, how value is created or destroyed, and who or what controls it. I think crypto and blockchain enable to create new financial products more suitable for a high-tech society. I am certain that with open blockchain infrastructure&nbsp; banking and financial services will be automated and will become more transparent and more trustworthy. I think in the 21st century, it&#8217;s important to look at the technology on how it can solve issues and not just stick to systems that have remained unchanged for hundreds of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With blockchain technology, smart contracts, automation, and artificial intelligence, the world of finance, banking, and insurance could change dramatically in the next years for the benefit of the users. These services can reach parts of the globe, which currently don&#8217;t have access to banking and financial services. Of course, a lot needs to be done on scalability and UI?UX before that. But that’s coming. For the developed world, I believe public, permissionless blockchain technology is the only viable deterretto the dystopian futures that could be created by states or corporations. Blockchain technology and crypto is leverage against these constantly increasing powers. Of course, crypto enthusiasts&nbsp; don&#8217;t have an army yet, so we need to rely on soft power. But soft power is becoming increasingly important in the 21st century. So when I think about blockchain and crypto &#8211;&nbsp; they&#8217;re not trying to destroy the existing financial and banking services, but want to push them towards greater transparency, and make them evolve in a way. So I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a war between the two but more of a synergy that we are going to witness in the future. Still, if things don’t go the way we want them in the traditional finance and banking space, we can always fall-back to public blockchain platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Do you think that crypto projects need stricter regulations? In the crypto space, we always talk about decentralization, but still, someone has to be responsible?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very complex and important issue. I think the transparency aspect is more important here because crypto is more easily trackable and identifiable. There are, of course, practices that enable people to completely or at least, to a large extent, conceal their identities. I think the crypto space is kind of self-regulating. But since the crypto market cap is growing to trillionsof dollars (that&#8217;s not a small amount, but in comparison to the rest of the financial and banking space it&#8217;s not large) regulators will become more interested in it. So regulations are coming. For the larger part of humanity, regulations will actually open the doors to crypto, the minority of cyberpunks, maximalists, idealists and people who are looking into crypto in a more philosophical way, will also get what they want in terms of decentralization and the whole spirit of the technology, but I think there will be a compromise made on both sides &#8211; between those who don&#8217;t want regulation and the ones that want full regulation. I believe we will meet somewhere in the middle. This will be a positive development, depending on what exactly these regulations look like. Some of the proposed regulations that I&#8217;ve seen sound impossible to implement in practice. It&#8217;s very interesting to see how far that will go. In the EU the regulation around  crypto and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/defi-decentralized-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">DeFi</a> will be formed by legislation but also some interesting European Court of Justice rulings. So regulation is inevitable, like it or not. It might change the user experience, but at the same time, it might bring a lot more users to the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Do you believe in true &#8220;decentralization&#8221; and to what extent do you think it can be achieved?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think everyone&#8217;s focusing on decentralization, and this is not the point here. I think trustlessness is more of a key point. The ability to be sure that certain applications cannot be stopped or affected by anyone that is out there, and are functioning as they are supposed to be, without anyone being able to stop them or modify them. Decentralization is actually not a natural state in our physical world when it comes to how systems work. A direct example here is the competitive advantages in economics, and production at scale &#8211;&nbsp; it&#8217;s much more efficient to create a factory that creates a specific product. So in terms of efficiency, it&#8217;s much more adequate to be centralized and many systems are pushing in this direction. So what we are actually trying to do here is fighting against natural laws in order to achieve robustness. But I don&#8217;t think that pure decentralization can be achieved. We can see that even in Bitcoin, which is one of the most decentralized blockchain networks. There are four pools that produce more than&nbsp; 75% of the entire network. They are composed of individual miners, yes, but there is still centralization. The economic incentives keeping the network running are more important than decentralization. I like the decentralization aspect because of the existence of copies of the blockchain, that&#8217;s what makes it valuable. But apart from that, I don&#8217;t think decentralization is what keeps it running. I think the strong economic (game-theoretical) incentives that Bitcoin established are what’s protecting the network. I am, however, a fan of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Proof of Work</a> and still believe it is the better <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Sybil attack mechanism</a> in comparison to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Proof of Stake</a>. PoW connects the blockchain with the real-world via the conversion of energy into crypto, while PoS relies only on questionable economic incentives. I don’t like losing that real-world connection, but that’s where most of the altcoin projects are heading. Let’s see how that will go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What do you think about Eth2.0 and what do you think makes it better than other platforms on the market?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>That is also a controversial topic. Everyone was looking forward to <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">ETH2.0</a>. It looks like it might be one of the best well-protected solutions because of the whole amount of Ether that is currently being staked in order to be mined. But, let&#8217;s see how it goes. It&#8217;s going to be the first major implementation &#8211; the proof of stake. I think it will be a process before we really make it robust and move away from the proof of work chain. What makes it good is just the fact that <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Ethereum</a> in general is a brand that is one of the best-known names in the technology world and is just second to Bitcoin. It has a huge amount of dev resources behind and it has institutional support and the Ethereum ecosystem is unlike any other solution out there. From a technological point of view, I really can&#8217;t say I haven&#8217;t looked into the details. And even if I have, I&#8217;m just a marketing guy, and I heavily rely on the opinions of other people. But keeping in mind how many years it has been working, and how many devs are actually working on it. I believe that it might be a success. I&#8217;m still not convinced that proof of stake is really the best technology out there and I also don&#8217;t think that Ethereum is currently the best technology out there. But it&#8217;s still the most popular so it enjoys the largest network effect. That is a guess again. The best technology does not always win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>It has recently been talked about the long-awaited Tapoot and Schnorr signatures in the Bitcoin space, do you think this is a step forward in favor of privacy and scalability for Bitcoin? What do you think about Bitcoin upgrades?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think those upgrades are very important and I am waiting for them impatiently, to be honest. They will make the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/running-full-bitcoin-node-over-tor-on-ubuntu/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Bitcoin network</a> more efficient without increasing the block size, and also make it more private. And this privacy is actually the part that I&#8217;m most interested in because I think Bitcoin requires more privacy. On the other hand, we have witnessed that some privacy coins were delisted by exchanges. So it&#8217;s interesting to see how that will work. What I think will happen is that some people will use the privacy-preserving features of the Bitcoin network, but exchanges and other big economic actors won&#8217;t. So in effect, the Bitcoin network will functionally be divided into a formal public and private-public network. . This will be the best way forward because if all transactions are private, large economic agents participating in the Bitcoin ecosystem will have a harder time serving users. But definitely, there should be some straightforward solution for privacy without resorting to mixer services. So all upgrades to the Bitcoin network are welcome. And of course, they need to be implemented very carefully, because we don&#8217;t want to lose any trust in the network. It&#8217;s very important to keep the Bitcoin network robust and well-secured.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What advice would you give to people who are just entering the Blockchain space, whether as users or developers?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, as users, I always give the advice to do some research and get some crypto. Even small amounts will push you further down the rabbit hole. You&#8217;ll start looking at charts more frequently, then you&#8217;ll be reading the news more frequently,&nbsp; at your position 24 times a day. Are you in profit? Are you at a loss? What are the reasons behind that and so on. That’s how you get hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for developers? Well, what can I say, it would be an interesting time for them. Because you know, <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/defi-decentralized-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">decentralized systems</a> are very different from centralized ones. The processes of developing, upgrading, and securing them are different. But definitely, I think this technology will be fundamental in the future. And I think blockchain will be in some form behind most of the banking and financial transactions after 5 to 10 years, unless something more efficient, or something more secure, manages to attract a large developer resource and liquidity. But again, as I said, it&#8217;s not always the best technology that wins, but the technology that most people are using. So join us in the blockchain space. It&#8217;s one of the most exciting spaces in 2021. It&#8217;s super-fast-paced. The scale and speed of innovation is just mind-boggling. And yeah, it&#8217;s never ever dull, so join the fun and get future-proofed.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In Part 1 of our interview with Vlad, we talked about Blockchain and DeFi projects, the current bull-run, and more.

Today, blockchain is a widely spread idea that is poised to change the very face of many industries, businesses, and the exchange of data. Considering the benefits and security blockchain offers, tech-heads are trying to employ different ideas to remove the central authority and disrupt various industries, of course for their own benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What is Blockchain?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we look at which industries Blockchain has the biggest impact and is likely to drastically change, let&#8217;s take a glance at what Blockchain is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A blockchain consists of a list of records known as blocks, which are linked to one another using cryptography forming a chain. Since each block comes with a cryptographic hash of the previous block, transaction data, and a timestamp, no data can be modified. This helps in recording transactions between two parties efficiently with better security and transactional transparency.&nbsp;The virtues of Blockchain technology lead to potential benefits including greater transparency, enhanced security, improved traceability, increased efficiency and speed of transactions, reduced costs, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain technology</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering these benefits and the security blockchain offers, it is most likely going to revolutionize many business sectors. But since there is no sure-shot of which industries will be disrupted and where organizations will fail,&nbsp;here are 5 industries that most likely to undergo a renaissance of their own:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Finance and Banking</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2400\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/@bermixstudio?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\">Bermix Studio</a> on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/coin?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Blockchain is particularly known from cryptocurrencies, it should be no surprise that the most common industry using blockchain, is banking and finance.&nbsp;According to a recent IBM survey, 91% of banks are investing in blockchain solutions, and 66% of institutions are expecting to be running at scale with blockchain. It seems that blockchain is finally poised to shake up financial markets in a way that will benefit both consumers and financial institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every day, millions of transactions take place in the banking sector and blockchain can help in maintaining a secure system that keeps permanent records of these transactions. This not only lowers the risk with better security but enables faster and cheaper transfer thanks to the decentralization offered by blockchain. From making cross-border payments faster to removing the costly middleman it’s already impacting the international as well as domestic banking network. Implementing distributed ledger technology in the banking sector is a great step towards making banks more profitable and valuable as this ledger is distributed, published, and stored in multiple locations and when a transaction occurs, it is added to each copy of the ledger. Because there are many copies of the ledger, blockchain is practically immutable to hackers and frauds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that many advantages, come many use cases. Here are some of them:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cross-border transactions &#8211; Using digital currency based on blockchain technology, one can easily transfer tokens from one place to another, that too without the use of a third-party organization.

At a global level, blockchain is being considered by many as a solution to the multiple challenges banks are facing in settlement and clearing, collateral management, KYC, trade finance, or digital identities. With growing enthusiasm for future growth among the banking CEOs (77% of CEOs of banks worldwide), implementing disruptive technologies like blockchain is on the initiative&#8217;s agendas. That sounds promising, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about how <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain benefits the Financial sector</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Healthcare</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2721\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/@nci?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">National Cancer Institute on Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s face it. The healthcare industry has been in need of a significant disruption when it comes to securing patient’s health records, lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical supply chain, lack of interoperability between databases holding patient health records, and dispersity of healthcare-related information, be it patients’ medical history or medical staff credentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the inherent security and decentralization, the benefits of blockchain in healthcare are numerous. That’s why blockchain technology is so important to the industry. It can revamp the trust by securely storing medical records that can be accurately and safely transferred to and accessed by the doctors and people who are authorized while eliminating the need for a central authority and enabling rapid access to data. It can improve the safety of patients’ electronic medical records, facilitates health data monetization, and enforces interoperability between healthcare organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another healthcare concern revolves around counterfeit medication and blockchain technology can control this, too. The problem is that, often, counterfeit medications are difficult to distinguish from real ones. Blockchain technology solves this problem by using supply chain management protocols where the medicine provenance can be traced, reducing revenue losses and guaranteeing patients safety. A BIR Research stated in a report titled “<a href=\"https://bisresearch.com/industry-report/global-blockchain-in-healthcare-market-2025.html\">Global Blockchain in Healthcare Market- Analysis and Forecast, 2017-2025</a>.” that “The most prominent beneficiaries of the technology will be the pharmaceutical companies, which lose approximately $200 billion to counterfeit drugs each year. By enabling complete visibility and transparency throughout the drug supply chain, blockchain will allow tracking of drugs to their point of origin and thus, help to eliminate falsified medication, reducing revenue loss by up to $43 billion annually for pharma companies,”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of healthcare organizations implementing Blockchain technology into their systems is rapidly growing. According to a<a href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/blockchain-market-in-healthcare\" class=\"rank-math-link\"> report</a>, the value of the blockchain market in the healthcare industry was $2.12 Billion in 2019 and estimated to reach $3.49 Billion by 2025. So there is nothing else to conclude except that the healthcare industry is among those that are about to be revolutionized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Checkout more on <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-healthcare/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain and Healthcare</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Supply Chain</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2723\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-432x576.jpg 432w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@tierramallorca?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Tierra Mallorca</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/supply-chain?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand how blockchain can transform the supply chain, let’s look at the challenges in the supply chain. Currently, the supply chain management system is plagued by a lack of efficiency and transparency and most networks face difficulties when trying to integrate all parties involved (suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, auditors, and consumers) and the current model makes it difficult to maintain a consistent and efficient supply chain system &#8211; which impacts negatively not only the profitability of the companies but also the final retail price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Blockchain technology is all about decentralization, transparency, and immutability, there is high interest in how Blockchains might transform the supply chain and logistics industry and solve its problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subsequently, Blockchain can increase the efficiency and transparency of supply chains and positively impact everything from warehousing to delivery to payment. Most importantly, Blockchain provides consensus—there is no dispute in the chain regarding transactions because all entities on the chain have the same version of the ledger. All this leads to less time delays, less human errors, less costs, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is estimated that the global blockchain supply chain market size was valued at $ 93.16 million in 2017, and is projected to reach $ 9,852.91 million by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 80.2% from 2018 to 2025. Big industry giants like Unilever, Nestle, Tyson, and Dole are now implementing blockchain projects and solutions for tracking and guaranteeing the authenticity of their products. Walmart is another company that uses blockchain to keep track of its pork it sources from China and the blockchain records where each piece of meat came from, processed, stored, and its sell-by-date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more on how <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain can improve Supply Chain Management</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Real Estate</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-1024x769.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2724\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-768x577.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-1536x1153.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-2048x1538.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-767x576.jpg 767w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@tierramallorca?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Tierra Mallorca</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/real-estate?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional real estate has always been a sphere of business for the “well-resourced” individuals and organizations. Moreover, a real estate business is extremely prone to high levels of corruption and dishonesty. According to the United Nations, from 800 billion to 2 trillion USD dollars is laundered globally every single year, of which the biggest part comes from real estate operations. According to the estimates of the United Nations, this figure is in the region of $1.6 trillion per year. And that is not all, obstacles such as lack of transparency, lack of liquidity, realtor and banking fees, transaction speed, frauds, etc. are driving people away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology can have a significant impact on solving these challenges, as it has the ability to benefit enterprises as well as individuals in many ways. One of the biggest impacts of Blockchain on commercial real estate would be a smoother, faster contract management process, automation of real estate transactions, acceleration, as well as becoming more accessible. Lets see some more use cases:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Blockchain makes the transaction process more efficient and cuts costs &#8211; Blockchain technology can make transactions of real estate more efficient and less costly by reducing the number of intermediaries. Transactions facilitated on a blockchain can be made within minutes and cost only a fraction of its current price. Expensive intermediaries, such as real estate agents, appraisers, and notaries are cut out of the process.</li><li>Blockchain makes the real estate industry more transparent &#8211; Blockchain technologies’ immutable and decentralized nature can have a significantly positive impact on transparency within the real estate market and can assist in combating money laundering and tax evasion. Through blockchain technology, documents, and events during the purchase of a property can be tracked, contracts become readable, and registries cannot be changed afterward. Furthermore, it also establishes an all-encompassing overview of where investments come from and who the actual owner of a property is. As a result, it becomes more difficult for criminal organizations to launder illegally obtained money through the purchase of properties.</li><li>Blockchain makes real estate investments more accessible &#8211; Blockchain technology enables new ways to invest in real estate which benefits companies as well as individuals. Blockchain technology allows individuals and companies to purchase and trade only fractions of real estate, and in turn, enables fast and easy transactions of ownership. This creates liquidity and ultimately makes the real estate industry more accessible.</li><li>Tokenization &#8211; Tokenization refers to the securitization of digital assets. After an asset has been tokenized, it can be divided into more granular pieces, hence it becomes available to a larger audience. In the case of real estate, tokenization reduces costs of investments, allows fast and easy transactions, and provides liquidity in an otherwise slow-moving industry. Consequently, it enables more people to invest in real estate, also investors with only minimal available capital.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All these use cases lead to benefits like &#8211; Faster and more efficient processing of transactions, No manipulation of ownership, Low transaction costs, Low barrier to investing in real estate, Professional opportunities for the regular investment community, and many more</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering all those benefits blockchain offers for the real estate industry, it should be a matter of time to be implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-real-estate/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain &amp; Real Estate</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Insurance</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2725\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-863x576.jpg 863w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@homajob?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Scott Graham</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/insurance?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The operational inefficiencies of the insurance industry are many: Loads of paperwork worsening the customer experience; complicated claims management presenting an operational nightmare for insurers; risks of fraud, lack of trust, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By switching to blockchain solutions, many opportunities lie ahead for the insurance industry. The new technology can optimize efficiency, security, and transparency for the entire insurance industry, using public ledgers and fortified cybersecurity protocol.

A passionate Blockchain enthusiast, Founder and Director of <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-bithope-foundation\">The BitHope Foundation</a> (the first Bitcoin crowdfunding platform in Europe), Co-Founder and Community Lead at <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Sofia-Crypto-Meetup/\">Sofia Crypto Meetup</a>, and Marketing Manager at <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://mettalex.com/\">Mettalex</a>. In this first part of our interview, we talked about the recent bull-run, the DeFi space, some interesting blockchain projects, and more. See what his opinion on these topics was:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How would you explain Blockchain to someone who never heard of the technology?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The way I explain Blockchain is &#8211; a distributed database copied 1000s of times, and whenever someone wants to make an edit or a change in that database, all of the other databases are notified and need to be updated as well. These changes to the database are governed by a set of rules also called consensus protocol. These rules are enforced by cryptography (laws of physics). <br><br>Currently, blockchain&#8217;s most viable and widely spread use is in the financial sector. Blockchain is used to store information about who owns what and any updates to this database are translated into transactions of changes of ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first blockchain database is actually <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/running-full-bitcoin-node-over-tor-on-ubuntu/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Bitcoin</a> and we have seen that Bitcoin has been functioning very well without any major issues for more than 12 years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What interesting projects have you encountered? What problems do they solve and in which areas are they most often linked to?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned Blockchain technology is most developed in the financial sector. You can store any type of information, but large files are expensive to store on a public blockchain. You cannot store videos, photos or even small files, but you can store their hashes and follow or monitor if any changes to have been made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can store unfalsifiable information about anything that has happened in the past via hash-based timestamps. This has numerous applications, for example, supply chain management where you can be certain about the lifecycle of a product thanks to the consecutive time-stamping by different supply chain participants along the product’s journey from raw material to the final product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another useful case is record-keeping by storing hashes of documents. When a specific version of a document has been first introduced, and you can check if it has been changed afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the blockchain system as the ultimate source of truth about a number of different questions like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Who owns what?</li><li>Who owned what?</li><li>When an action was done and by whom?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is a new type of technology that enables truth-keeping. And that’s at the core of our civilization!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What are the differences between the previous Bull-Run in 2017 and the recent jump in cryptocurrency prices?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the previous bull-run was provoked primarily by ICOs, causing a very high demand for Ether and Bitcoin, in particular, and that&#8217;s why the price of these two currencies really increased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of other coins increased as well because there was a lot of hype around Bitcoin and Ethereum. Everyone was looking for the “next bitcoin” and ICO teams were promising users fantastical applications. The narrative was that basically any problem can be solved with a blockchain. Which is definitely not true. Furthermore, the infrastructure was nowhere near ready for 95% of all the decentralized apps that were promised. Back then the bull-run was primarily caused by retail investors, regular guys with small amounts of money, who were looking to make a quick buck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the ICO extravaganza was a prerequisite for decentralized finance (DeFi) to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference now is that technology has matured significantly. There are many use cases that can be realistically realized (and are being realized). There is also DeFi on Ethereum</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as a brand name, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are much more known and much more trusted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real change that happened in 2020 was the outbreak of the Corona Virus pandemic, which caused economic devastation around the globe. That led to uncertainty and excessive printing of money. Central banks are just increasing the monetary supply to levels that we have never seen before. This pushes investors to move away from fiat, due to inflation expectations. That’s one of the main reasons that push investors into cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin because they. Bitcoin has existed for more than a decade and hasn’t had any major hacks or glitches, it&#8217;s the first cryptocurrency, it’s the first blockchain, it&#8217;s robust and it&#8217;s the most secured one. In 2020, it proved that rules that were set in the protocol back in 2009, when the system launched, continue to be perfectly executed 11 years after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, it&#8217;s very limited. There will ever be just 21 million bitcoins and 20% of them are lost or locked forever. So, there is a very limited supply of this digital asset that could be sent all around the globe for a few satoshis, irrespective of what amount is being sent. People or companies can transfer millions or even billions in bitcoin for a couple of cents/dollars in transaction fees and can store them quite effortlessly without the risk of falsification. A bitcoin cannot be faked. Unlike, for example, Gold, which is a pain to transport, secure and has been faked for thousands of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>In your opinion, does the recent jump in the price of bitcoin fundamentally affect the technology itself and people&#8217;s interest, or is it just hype?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I think there are a lot of fundamental reasons why the price is rising. As I mentioned, Bitcoin is a unique asset, a new asset class, that retail, investors with big pockets, corporations, and financial institutions are considering for portfolio diversification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve also witnessed its price history in the last 12 years and the fact that it has performed phenomenally. And it&#8217;s this limited supply feature that is essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is definitely not only hype. The world is going high-tech. Fiat currency is collapsing. Whole economies are in tatters. Users are fleeing to scarce assets. Bitcoin’s enormous advantage is that it has solved digital scarcity, making it extremely suitable for the digital age and highly useful to high-tech new generations.&nbsp; There is an element of hype, of course, because people are looking at the price going up, and they&#8217;re FOMOed about it but there are a lot of fundamentals under that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What is your opinion about the DeFi space and are there any projects that you find interesting and encouraging?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a large audience of investors both retail and institutional are discovering the DeFi space. I&#8217;m super bullish about it as well. I believe that it is the logical continuation of the Bitcoin idea. It is definitely not “De” yet, but we are getting there. It is impossible to solve decentralization for such complex applications too quickly. Currently, the Defi ecosystem is well-developed primarily on Ethereum, but I think due to the high gas fees, DeFi ecosystems are being developed on other platforms and more advanced infrastructure as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think ecosystems on other chains will develop and they will also converge. The next big and interesting thing, which will come to DeFi, is to follow how regulations will affect the space. Currently logging in with just a Web 3 wallet, it&#8217;s great, the onboarding is quick but this will have to change at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to see how DeFiusers will react to any KYC and AML. There are a number of solutions there that I like in this respect like <a href=\"https://www.yoti.com/\">YOTI</a>. I think this need for KYC/AML in DeFi will push the development of self-sovereign identity solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some projects I&#8217;m interested in &#8211; Aave, Uniswap, UMA, Compound (I&#8217;ve entered in DeFi through it). I was using Compound to generate an interest rate on a deposit in USDC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very interested in L2 solutions such as Optimism, Matic, Polkadot, ZK-Rollups. I would like to see how this will work in the real world, and also keen to see if Uniswap V3 will integrate with Optimism. I believe this could be a game-changer because currently the gas fees are just crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course I&#8217;m interested in <a href=\"https://mettalex.com/\">Mettalex</a> &#8211; the project I&#8217;m currently involved in. It aims to build a decentralized commodity derivatives exchange. We believe that all assets are moving on-chain and would like toWe bring new commodity markets to the DeFi space. This will enable speculators to short or longSteel, Zinc, Lithium Carbonate, Natural Gas, Iron Ore, spreads like BTC/Gold, BTC/Oil, and even sDEFI/sCEX. We are constantly researching what new markets users may be interested in. But actually, users will be able to create markets themselves. Mettalex also enables liquidity providers (LPs) to supply stablecoins to Mettalex’s Autonomous Market Makers and be rewarded in trading fees and governance tokens. This is actually one of the unique features of Mettalex &#8211; 87.5% of all MTLX tokens will be distributed to liquidity providers in a period of 8+ years. No ICO/IEO, no whales, no large team and advisers distribution. The tokenomics logic is similar to that of Bitcoin where miners who provide utility to the network get rewarded with new bitcoins. In the case of Mettalex &#8211; the utility is liquidity, and the rewards are in MTLX tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another unique part about Mettalex is that it is trying to solve real-world issues for physical commodity holders. Those are medium and small-sized enterprises that are dealing with the actual commodities themselves in the physical world &#8211; we are providing them with a low-cost hedging solution so they can manage risks in a cost and capital-efficient way. The project is Cambridge, UK-based and the Founder and CEO &#8211; Humayun Sheikh, is very experienced in the tech sector and in trading commodities. He actually was a founding investor in DeepMind which was later bought by Google for $500m. Mettalex is a spin-off of <a href=\"https://fetch.ai/\">Fetch.ai </a>which is focusing on developing advanced blockchain infrastructure, decentralized AI-based oracles, and a global internet-of-things economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What are the steps to be followed for a successful project in the blockchain space?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very interesting question and at the same time it’s a very hard one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people that are best suited to successfully implement/create projects in the DeFi space are often developers who have an economic or financial background. Because the core of decentralized finance is a kind of crossover between finance, technology, and blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So apart from having the skills, you&#8217;ll have to have a great design and marketing team to get the word out. Currently, it&#8217;s very noisy in the DeFi space, because many different companies are out there, trying to promote their products, fighting for liquidity. It&#8217;s a super competitive field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very core though, you need to get the tokenomics, which actually refers to the game-theoretical incentives, right. This goes back to economics and getting the token economics right (most DeFi defy projects are featuring tokens). So it&#8217;s essential to get the tokenomics right. You have to also be careful how you go to market, how you promote your product, how you distribute the tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also have to listen to the community very closely and make sure their reasonable requests are met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What could help is to have a background in finance and/or trading, in the real financial world, or experience in a company that&#8217;s finance or banking-focused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surely, the team and the experience of its members are of paramount importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you need to make as much as possible to audit the code well and avoid any loss of trust. That’s the most valuable resource in the crypto/DeFi space (and actually in the real-world). Once you lose it, it is hard to get it back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>If an investor is looking for a Blockchain development company to partner with to run his project, what are the criteria for making the choice? What to look for?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s pretty straightforward. The development company should have a good track record of working with other projects and be proficient with Solidity, and all the application-level languages like Javascript, Python, GO, and Java. Having built various SDKs and Middleware-types of software is a big plus since it means that the company is aware of fundamental blockchain principles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe it&#8217;s important to get acquainted with what projects have these companies developed and worked on before. Some of them are consultants as well. So they need to be able to consult the client on what is the best solution, what fits them, and if this specific solution requires a blockchain at all. Most clients are not very versed in the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s also important how quickly certain products can be delivered. And of course, the cost is very important for many. Standard stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the company is a one-stop-shop with marketing services, community services, content services, and everything this could be also useful, but might be a bit controversial, because it&#8217;s good for the company to be focused on one thing or a few things only. The larger it becomes the more slowly it moves and the less innovative it becomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read so far then you liked what Vlad has to say about the blockchain and DeFi space.

Why run Bitcoin node? Why Tor?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why Bitcoin full node?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A full node allows you to participate in the verification of all the transactions and blocks in the Bitcoin network and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/blockchain-software-development/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">blockchain</a>. Almost all of the full nodes participate in this validation process and relay the transactions and blocks to other nodes they &#8220;know&#8221; (are connected to).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Running a full node helps Bitcoin&#8217;s peer-to-peer network grow and be more decentralized, so clients won&#8217;t have to rely on centralized services for querying the network or transmitting transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Many people and organizations volunteer to run full nodes using spare computing and bandwidth resources—but more volunteers are needed to allow Bitcoin to continue to grow. This document describes how you can help and what helping will cost you. </p><cite>https://bitcoin.org/en/full-node#what-is-a-full-node</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Following few steps you will be able to setup a bitcoin full node running on the Tor network (privacy matters).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why run on Tor?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin is said to be many things, amongst them anonymity is one of the features to stand out. It is not entirely true the transactions in the network are anonymous, rather pseudonymous, and while it is true that a transaction does not identify a user or wallet, there is a potential for privacy to be partially undermined, by methods that could identify the IP address of a transaction originator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you care about your digital privacy &#8211; keep reading. 🥷</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Tor</strong>&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software\">free and open-source software</a>&nbsp;for enabling&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity\">anonymous communication</a>&nbsp;by directing Internet traffic through a free, worldwide, volunteer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network\">overlay network</a>&nbsp;consisting of more than seven thousand relays<sup><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network)#cite_note-torstatus-6\">[6]</a></sup>&nbsp;in order to conceal a user&#8217;s location and usage from anyone conducting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_and_network_surveillance#Network_surveillance\">network surveillance</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis#In_computer_security\">traffic analysis</a>.

Setup SSH</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are using a VPS or other cloud machine which you can access via SSH, or your machine already has SSH enabled you can skip this step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"http://ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a> 20.04 LTS Desktop and Server come without SSH service enabled by default, which we need to be able to access remotely our machine, but you can easily enable it by just one command.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This command will install <a href=\"http://www.openssh.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">OpenSSH</a>, which provides free SSH connectivity tools and supports all SSH protocol versions. OpenSSH encrypts all the traffic to eliminate possible eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: The default port for SSH is 22, but you can configure it to run on a port of your choice by editing the config file at <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, and apply the changes by restarting the service <code>sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have UFW firewall running on your machine, you will need to allow incoming SSH connections. Type the following command:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo ufw allow ssh</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After running it you should see the output below.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Output\nRules updated\nRules updated (v6)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: If you changed the default SSH port (22) to a custom port, you will need to open that port instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your ssh daemon listens on port&nbsp;<code>4242</code>, then you can use the following command to allow connections on that port:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo ufw allow 4242/tcp</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we are setup with the SSH configuration we can proceed to the real deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>02. Install packages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to install some packages needed for compilation of bitcoin&#8217;s source code.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo add-apt-repository universe</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible this is already added, so you might see something like <code>'universe' distribution component is already enabled for all sources.</code> If so &#8211; just ignore it and proceed further.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libtool pkg-config libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libevent-dev doxygen libzmqpp-dev libdb++-dev</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>03. Install BerkelyDB</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin Core is still using BerkleyDB 4.8.30 because of backward compatibility. Using a newer versions makes the wallet incompatible with older versions, making downgrade impossible (or at least difficult).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can do this manually by downloading it via `wget`.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>wget http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Then verifying the hash of the file:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>echo '12edc0df75bf9abd7f82f821795bcee50f42cb2e5f76a6a281b85732798364ef db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz' | sha256sum -c</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Extracting the archive:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>tar -xvf db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Configure and build the BerkleyDB for unix</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>cd db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>mkdir -p buildBDB_PREFIX=$(pwd)/build../dist/configure --disable-shared --enable-cxx --with-pic --prefix=$BDB_PREFIX</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>make install</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The above may fail with an error similar to this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>In file included from ../dist/../dbinc/mutex_int.h:12, from ../dist/../dbinc/mutex.h:15, from ./db_int.h:884, from ../dist/../cxx/cxx_db.cpp:11: ../dist/../dbinc/atomic.h:179:19: error: definition of ‘int __atomic_compare_exchange(db_atomic_t*, atomic_value_t, atomic_value_t)’ ambiguates built-in declaration ‘bool __atomic_compare_exchange(long unsigned int, volatile void*, void*, void*, int, int)’ 179 | static inline int __atomic_compare_exchange(</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If so you will need to apply some patches for C++11 which are required for the build. The developers at bitcoin have provided a nice shell script which does the downloading, verification and installation of those automatically here <code>https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/install_db4.sh</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can fetch and run it like so:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/master/contrib/install_db4.sh\nchmod +x install_db4.sh\n./install_db4.sh .</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After few minutes you should see a message including <code>db4 build complete.</code> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also see some more info about flags which you should use for compiling bitcoind (don&#8217;t worry if you did not copy those &#8211; you will find them below).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>04. Compile Bitcoin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to compile bitcoin, we first need to clone the source code repository from Github. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to checkout a version tag so we don&#8217;t run into problems, building from the <code>master</code> branch, as there the developers are constantly pushing new code.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>cd bitcoin\ngit checkout v0.21.0\ngit status</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After checking out the release tag and running the status check you should see this message:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>HEAD detached at v0.21.0\nnothing to commit, working tree clean</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time for us to build the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>./autogen.sh</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>export BDB_PREFIX='${BDB_PREFIX}'\n./configure BDB_LIBS=\"-L${BDB_PREFIX}/lib -ldb_cxx-4.8\" BDB_CFLAGS=\"-I${BDB_PREFIX}/include\"</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>make\nmake check\nsudo make install</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We now have successfully compiled bitcoin! 🚀🔥🎉</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>05. Configure Bitcoin to use Tor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-38be3746-3589-4fa3-a065-8cd02e28d84d\">Before staring syncing the blockchain history we need to configure some settings for our bitcoin node.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"block-38be3746-3589-4fa3-a065-8cd02e28d84d\" class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>cd ~\nmkdir .bitcoin\ntouch .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf\necho \"txindex=1\" >> .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up <code>txindex=1</code> will make Bitcoin rescan the whole blockchain and rebuild the whole database. This can take several days depending on your hardware and internet connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Tor is properly setup in our system bitcoind will be able to communicate to other nodes over Tor network, otherwise it will default for communication over TCP. As we care about our privacy we want to explicitly forbid communication over TCP and allow it to only use Tor. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>echo \"onlynet=onion\" >> .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Setup a maximum number of inbound + outbound connections the node can use, so it does not drain your bandwidth.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>echo \"maxconnections=20\" >> .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As already mentioned the initial bitcoin blockchain download takes few days to weeks and using Tor will make this time longer as the Tor network is a bottleneck. One reason for that is due to low-bandwidth volunteer-operated Tor routers, but with wider adoption and volunteers running nodes this will change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing Tor on Ubuntu is pretty straightforward and easy:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt install tor</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After the installation is complete we need to check the configuration and ensure we have all of these configurations in <code>/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc</code></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>ControlPort 9051\nCookieAuthentication 1\nCookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To view the file we can use <code>less</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>less /usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In case any of those configuration settings is missing, use `echo` to add it to the file:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo sh -c \"echo 'ControlPort 9051' >> /usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc\"</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"block-38be3746-3589-4fa3-a065-8cd02e28d84d\" class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">If you did edit the file, make sure to restart the Tor service:</pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Next step is to allow <code>bitcoind</code> to access to Tor, by adding it to that user group. Replace <code>username</code> with the Ubuntu account username you are operating under.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor username</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally we can launch Bitcoin over Tor: 🙌🥳</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bitcoind -daemon</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We can follow the logs and monitor progress of the node syncing using <code>tail</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>tail -f ~/.bitcoin/debug.log</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetching <code>getnetworkinfo</code> should result in IPv4 and IPv6 flags set to <code>false</code> and Tor to `true`. This will ensure us that we are operating our node privately.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, after the sync, we can use <code>bitcoin-cli</code> for querying information for the network status, connections and transaction and blocks information. Get peer info:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | grep true</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspect a raw transaction:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction 0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And inspect the raw output:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff0704ffff001d0104ffffffff0100f2052a0100000043410496b538e853519c726a2c91e61ec11600ae1390813a627c66fb8be7947be63c52da7589379515d4e0a604f8141781e62294721166bf621e73a82cbf2342c858eeac00000000</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-26b33e98-5d62-4b3f-901c-2970218ead0e\">References and resources</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/install_db4.sh \" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/install_db4.sh</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18846 \" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18846</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/depends/packages/bdb.mk#L17 \" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/depends/packages/bdb.mk#L17</a></li><li><a href=\"https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/79758/bitcoin-built-with-a-newer-berkeley-database-incompatible-with-a-older-wallet \" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/79758/bitcoin-built-with-a-newer-berkeley-database-incompatible-with-a-older-wallet</a></li><li><a href=\"https://8bitcoin.medium.com/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-full-node-over-tor-on-an-ubuntu-linux-virtual-machine-bdd7e9415a70 \" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://8bitcoin.medium.com/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-full-node-over-tor-on-an-ubuntu-linux-virtual-machine-bdd7e9415a70</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch03.asciidoc \" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch03.asciidoc</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4y7nc3/create_bitcoin_full_node_with_tor_step_by_step/?st=j5n7z1q1&amp;sh=392084c9\" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4y7nc3/create_bitcoin_full_node_with_tor_step_by_step/?st=j5n7z1q1&amp;sh=392084c9</a></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>00.

Core principles:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Modularity: enables the creation of modules that adapt a chosen blockchain for the custom user needs.</li><li>Security: each module encapsulates its functionality and governs the communication with other modules.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-sdk-tendermint-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2542\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-sdk-tendermint-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-sdk-tendermint-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-sdk-tendermint-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-sdk-tendermint-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-sdk-tendermint.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Cosmos SDK and modules</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Inter-Blockchain Communication</strong> protocol enables the communication between blockchains. By utilizing the instant finality of Tendermint consensus it connects heterogeneous chains together. POW chains are not part of this category because they have probabilistic-finality.<br>IBC provides sovereignty by setting validators for different blockchains that have to approve new consequent blocks on the chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cosmos makes use of star-based modular architecture which has two kinds of blockchains &#8211; Hubs and Zones. Hubs connect Zones together. Every Zone can be accessed from others through a Hub. Thus the number of connections is optimised to a minimum in order to establish communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hubs use the native token of Cosmos (ATOM) to allocate resources from one Zone to another.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-hub-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2544\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-hub-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-hub-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-hub-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-hub-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-hub.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Cosmos Hub</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Communication between probabilistic-finality chains is handled by so called Peg-Zone blockchains. It monitors the state of another blockchain to establish a finality for transactions of the blockchain it bridges.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-pegzone-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2546\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-pegzone-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-pegzone-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-pegzone-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-pegzone-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/hack-cosmos-pegzone.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Cosmos Peg Zone</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cosmos provides Vertical and Horizontal scalability.</strong><br>Vertical scalability is achieved through its consensus mechanism Tendermint BFT which could handle up to thousands of transactions per second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Horizontal scalability &#8211;  multiple parallel chains running the same application and verified by a common validator set. In theory creates infinite scalability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Resolving the aforementioned limitations of the existing blockchain networks enables more space for creative ideas and trust. Being able to focus on specific problems without being limited or blocked by the underlying environment multiplies the efficiency and accelerates the growth of the technical domain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cosmos breaks the ice between blockchains and gives a new push for the collaboration between different ecosystems. <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-are-smart-contracts-and-blockchain-adding-value-to-my-business/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Businesses</a> depending on a specific blockchain network are set for a ride on the rocket of sky-high growth and limitless more creative ideas for <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/defi-decentralized-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">DeFi applications</a>.
