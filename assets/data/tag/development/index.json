Participants will also understand how to apply State Channels and Oracles to develop real-world applications that solve both business and social problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The workshop will be held on 7th June 2019 at Room M1</em></strong> and will be divided into two sessions: one in the morning (starting\nat 11:00), and another in the afternoon (starting at 15:00), each featuring two\ntracks:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Track\n1: æternity Theoretics (45 mins)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first session will feature a brief introduction to blockchain technology, shifting to an introduction to æternity’s protocol, architecture, features, and mechanics. Participants will learn about <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contract </a>programming with Sophia ML, how to use Oracles for real-world data integration, and State Channels for scalability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Track\n2: Building on æternity (2hours)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of the workshop will be dedicated to a practical exercise in which participants will learn how to set up the development environment and initialize projects using æternity’s Dev Suite. Participants will gain first-hand experience in writing a <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/building-voting-aepp-with-sophia-ml-on-aeternity-blockchain/\">simple æpp with Sophia ML</a>, familiarize themselves with the interface, and delve deeper into building æpps on the platform. The track will expose participants to State Channels, smart contract initialization, and execution, and teach them how to implement lists in states, create structures, define and implement logic, test smart contracts, and make use of Oracles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here\nis the workshop schedule:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Session 1</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:00 &#8211; 11:15 &#8211; Welcome coffee<br>11:15 &#8211; 12:00 &#8211; æternity Theoretics<br>12:00 &#8211; 13:00 &#8211; Lunch<br>13:00 &#8211; 15:00 &#8211; Building on æternity</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Session 2</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>15:00 &#8211; 15:15 &#8211; Welcome coffee<br>15:15 &#8211; 16:00 &#8211;  æternity Theoretics<br>16:00 &#8211; 16:05 &#8211; Break<br>16:05 &#8211; 18:00 &#8211; Building on æternity</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The æternity team welcomes all curious\ndevelopers to a journey of exploration of the vast æternity Universe!\nRefreshments will be provided during the workshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come and find out why æternity’s\ninfrastructure is the best solution to the demands of any decentralized\napplication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prerequisite for participation at this workshop is a valid ticket for the <a href=\"https://events.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress/tickets/\">WeAreDevelopers World Congress </a>2019.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Experience State Channel Technology First-Hand—Join the æternity Development Crash Course!

What are the benefits? How to develop them and what are they good for? <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milen Radkov had prepared for us some exciting presentation. Let&#8217;s find out!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who could not attend we would like to give you the meetup plan. This time we had 2 parts. On the first <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">part</g> we <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">talked</g> how things in Polkadot work in theory and on the second part we focused on the code and the tools that are doing the magic.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started with the well know to all blockchain developers Smart Contracts functions. When we think about it &#8211; it is really cool that one can write a dApp and push it to the network without permission, knowing that this app will live “forever” without worrying that somebody is going to change his logic, but we all know that the current solutions are not perfect. We are also limited by the computational complexity and the price that we have to pay for it.

We love this topic and we believe it is here to stay, so we intend to make these meetups be “from developers to developers” and share knowledge in our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing knowledge is what this meetup group is for. Blockchain technology is in its infancy, so every bit of new information is very valuable and is helping the community to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our meetup is being held monthly and is focused on the development practices and trends in the blockchain area. It is 100% non-profit oriented and motivated by our love for this topic, our passion for open source, knowledge sharing, constant learning, meeting new people and having fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can visit our meetup page and be part of our community as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-meetup-com wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-meetup\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<style type=\"text/css\">#meetup_oembed .mu_clearfix:after { visibility: hidden; display: block; font-size: 0; content: \" \"; clear: both; height: 0; }* html #meetup_oembed .mu_clearfix, *:first-child+html #meetup_oembed .mu_clearfix { zoom: 1; }#meetup_oembed { background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:10px;-moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;border-radius:3px;margin:0; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; }#meetup_oembed h3 { font-weight:normal; margin:0 0 10px; padding:0; line-height:26px; font-family:Georgia,Palatino,serif; font-size:24px }#meetup_oembed p { margin: 0 0 10px; padding:0; line-height:16px; }#meetup_oembed img { border:none; margin:0; padding:0; }#meetup_oembed a, #meetup_oembed a:visited, #meetup_oembed a:link { color: #1B76B3; text-decoration: none; cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; }#meetup_oembed a:hover { color: #1B76B3; text-decoration: underline; }#meetup_oembed a.mu_button { font-size:14px; -moz-border-radius:3px;-webkit-border-radius:3px;border-radius:3px;border:2px solid #A7241D;color:white!important;text-decoration:none;background-color: #CA3E47; background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #ca3e47, #a8252e); background-image: -webkit-gradient(linear, left bottom, left top, color-stop(0, #a8252e), color-stop(1, #ca3e47));disvplay:inline-block;padding:5px 10px; }#meetup_oembed a.mu_button:hover { color: #fff!important; text-decoration: none; }#meetup_oembed .photo { width:50px; height:50px; overflow:hidden;background:#ccc;float:left;margin:0 5px 0 0;text-align:center;padding:1px; }#meetup_oembed .photo img { height:50px }#meetup_oembed .number { font-size:18px; }#meetup_oembed .thing { text-transform: uppercase; color: #555; }</style><div id=\"meetup_oembed\" style=\"height:335px\">     <div style=\"overflow:hidden;max-height:295px\">          <h3>Blockchain Developers Meetup (Bulgaria)</h3>          <p style=\"margin:0 0 10px;font-size:12px;line-height:16px;\">Sofia, BG <br />          <span style=\"font-size:14px;font-weight:bold;\">129</span> <em>Developers</em></p>          <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain-Developers-Meetup-Bulgaria/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/6/0/a/7/600_472464743.jpeg\" style=\"float:right;max-width:150px;margin-right:0;\" /></a>                          <div style=\"margin-right:170px;line-height:16px;\">In this group, we will share knowledge about blockchain and smart contract development.
