These protocols provide a strong probabilistic safety guarantee in the presence of Byzantine adversaries while their concurrent and leaderless nature enables them to achieve high throughput and scalability.  Unlike blockchains that rely on proof-of-work, they are quiescent and green. Unlike traditional consensus protocols where one or more nodes typically process linear bits in the number of total nodes per decision, no node processes more than logarithmic bits.  It does not require accurate knowledge of all participants and exposes new possible tradeoffs and improvements in safety and liveness for building consensus protocols. The paper describes the Snow protocol family, analyzes its guarantees, and describes how it can be used to construct the core of an internet-scale electronic payment system called Avalanche, which is evaluated in a large scale deployment.  Experiments demonstrate that the system can achieve high throughput  (3400tps), provide low confirmation latency (1.35  sec),  and scale well compared to existing systems that deliver similar functionality. For our implementation and setup, the bottleneck of the system is in transaction verification.</p><cite>https://avalabs.org/QmT1ry38PAmnhparPUmsUNHDEGHQusBLD6T5XJh4mUUn3v.pdf</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s even a really nice graphical demo here: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://avalabs.org/snow-bft-demo/#/snow\" target=\"_blank\">https://avalabs.org/snow-bft-demo/#/snow</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DappCon</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>DappCon focuses on decentralized applications, tooling, and foundational infrastructure on Ethereum. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This event is bringing together hundreds of blockchain and smart contracts developers, researchers and enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This years edition was a great place for anyone in interested in the ecosystem or networking with dapp developers to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>ETHBerlin hackathon</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We assume if you’re reading this document, that you know what ETHBerlin Zwei is, but to recap: ETHBerlin Zwei is a combination of a hackathon, experiences, workshops and talks, happening from 21st till 25th of August 2019 in Berlin, Germany.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Although we did not participated hacking at the ETHBerlin hackathon, there were quite big amount of other clever people there, which didn&#8217;t stayed unnoticed (our friends from AirGap got to win one of the prizes). </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aeternity Meetup</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the peak of the 10+days long event &#8211; Blockchain Week Berlin aeternity invited developers to join and meet at the Blockchain Embassy and talk blockchain, with beers and pizzas!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1545\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Philipp Piwowarsky &amp; Milen Radkov presenting at Aeternity Meetup Berlin</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Philipp and Milen did an Introduction to <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/build-your-first-decentralized-application-aepp-on-aeternity-blockchain-sophia-smart-contract-address-book/\">Sophia Smart Contracts</a> on æternity.
