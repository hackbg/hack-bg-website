Their team is dedicated to the development and integration of Chainlink as the standard decentralized oracle framework used by smart contracts across any blockchain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://terra.money\">Terra Protocol</a> aims to create a programmable algorithmic stablecoin available on every blockchain. The project was created by a partnership of 15 large Asia-based e-commerce companies that focuses on building efficient, scalable, competitive programmable payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Terra Protocol ecosystem features numerous leading DeFi applications including Mirror Protocol, which allows users to mint synthetic assets that track real-world assets such as US equities. With native support for Chainlink oracles, Terraâ€™s ecosystem of DeFi applications such as Mirror will gain access to the most trustworthy source of external data.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>We are very pleased to announce that we have been selected as a recipient of a blockchain integration grant for [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"6","title":"Partnerships","path":"/category/partnerships/"}],"author":{"name":"Milen","path":"/author/milen/"}}}]}}},"context":{}}
