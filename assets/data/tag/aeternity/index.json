This also involves a wide variety of technology stack options, depending on the desired outcome and use-case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purpose of this tutorial though, we will develop an app from scratch to a working decentralized application on aeternity blockchain with a simple frontend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let the timer start:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Initialize our project</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We will use the <a href=\"https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-aeproject-js\">aeproject</a> tool which will allow us to easily set up the development environment locally.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>dependencies<ul><li>docker</li><li>npm &amp; node</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Install globally</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>npm install -g aeproject</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Initialize project</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aeproject init</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Write our smart contract(s)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this step, we will develop a simple smart contract that is only storing an integer (number) in its state on the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s also add a getter method which will allow us to read from the contract state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, we will do something like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>@compiler >= 4\n\ncontract MyContract =\n   record state = { number: int }\n   entrypoint init() : state = { number = 0 }\n   stateful entrypoint set(x: int) = put(state{number = x})\n   stateful entrypoint get() : int = state.number</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In our case, we can further simplify our contract since we are only storing a single integer value. As we know Sophia contracts have restricted mutable state and it is a strongly typed language so we need to define it initially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, we can define our <code>state</code> to be of <code>type</code> <code>int</code> as we don&#8217;t need the whole <code>record</code> structure for this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>@compiler >= 4\n\ncontract MyContract =\n   type state = int\n   entrypoint init() : state = 0\n   stateful entrypoint set(x: int) = put(x)\n   stateful entrypoint get() : int = state</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the same contract, written in Solidity, on Ethereum blockchain just for comparison if you are more familiar with Solidity &#8230; or not:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>pragma solidity >=0.5.0 &lt;0.6.0; \n\ncontract MyContract {\n    uint256 number;\n    constructor() public {\n        number = 0;\n    }\n    function set(uint256 _number) public {\n        number = _number;\n    }\n    function get() public view returns (uint256) {\n        return number;    \n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Deploy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order for us to deploy to an actual <code>testnet</code> or <code>mainnet</code> we need to have some AE tokens on the selected network, so we can pay the mining fee for the transactions we will make to the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: We could also deploy it on a local testnet which can be started via <code>aeproject node</code></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3.1. Create a wallet</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If we do not yet have a wallet which will be used for deployment we need to generate ourselves one:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aecli account create &lt;WALLET_NAME></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Note: To quickly test all of Aeternity's blockchain features from your Terminal, you can Install and use our NodeJS CLI by running:\n\nnpm i -g @aeternity/aepp-cli\naecli --help</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>3.2. Fund the wallet</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We will get some testnet AE tokens from the <a href=\"https://faucet.testnet.aepps.com\">faucet</a>, so we can deploy the contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3.3. Get our private key</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to be deploying via the command-line interface (CLI), so we will need to have our private key to pass it to the deployer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get our private key:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aecli account address &lt;WALLET_NAME> --privateKey</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>3.4. Deploy to testnet</h4>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aeproject deploy -n testnet -s &lt;SECRET_KEY> --compiler https://latest.compiler.aepps.com</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Interaction with the contract</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are multiple we can interact with our contract. The first and most easier is to use one of the online IDEs available out there &#8211; contracts.aeternity.art, fireeditor etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>4.1. Online IDE.</h4>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>contracts.aeternity.art &#8211; we put our contract code in the editor and we can access our contract by adding the address in the <code>&lt;Address&gt;</code> field so we can interact with it.<br> <code>set</code> &#8211; for setting a new value in the smart contract we have to make a stateful call (which modifies the state and costs gas)<br><code>get</code> &#8211; our getter we can access by calling static function.<br></li><li>fireeditor.nikitafuchs.de &#8211; Same as above we can put our contract code and access the freshly deployed contract <strong>at address</strong>.<br></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h4>4.2. via the SDK</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We can access our contract instance via this simple command and start interacting with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><code>await sdk.getContractInstance(CONTRACT_SOURCE, { contractAddress: OUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS} );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course we will first have to set up our project and intialize the SDK there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Fully-fledged Decentralized app</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>5.1. Set up frontend</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to setup our simple fronted we will use the waellet boilerplate repo which is pre-configured to communicate with the waellet extension and has the aeternity javascript sdk already prepared there. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>git clone https://github.com/waellet/waellet-aepp-boilerplate &amp;&amp; cd\nnpm install</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>5.2. Add the contract interface (or the full contract code)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to add our contract interface in the app, so we can call the correct methods and encode the transactions properly. This is similar to the ABI in Solidity for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-1024x460.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1763\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-1024x460.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-300x135.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-768x345.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-1038x466.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25.png 1310w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>https://github.com/waellet/waellet-aepp-boilerplate/blob/23419a910f668069990f96b775bd119aba70f8d3/src/views/Home/Index.vue#L204-L216</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>5.3.

These protocols provide a strong probabilistic safety guarantee in the presence of Byzantine adversaries while their concurrent and leaderless nature enables them to achieve high throughput and scalability.  Unlike blockchains that rely on proof-of-work, they are quiescent and green. Unlike traditional consensus protocols where one or more nodes typically process linear bits in the number of total nodes per decision, no node processes more than logarithmic bits.  It does not require accurate knowledge of all participants and exposes new possible tradeoffs and improvements in safety and liveness for building consensus protocols. The paper describes the Snow protocol family, analyzes its guarantees, and describes how it can be used to construct the core of an internet-scale electronic payment system called Avalanche, which is evaluated in a large scale deployment.  Experiments demonstrate that the system can achieve high throughput  (3400tps), provide low confirmation latency (1.35  sec),  and scale well compared to existing systems that deliver similar functionality. For our implementation and setup, the bottleneck of the system is in transaction verification.</p><cite>https://avalabs.org/QmT1ry38PAmnhparPUmsUNHDEGHQusBLD6T5XJh4mUUn3v.pdf</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s even a really nice graphical demo here: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://avalabs.org/snow-bft-demo/#/snow\" target=\"_blank\">https://avalabs.org/snow-bft-demo/#/snow</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DappCon</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>DappCon focuses on decentralized applications, tooling, and foundational infrastructure on Ethereum. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This event is bringing together hundreds of blockchain and smart contracts developers, researchers and enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This years edition was a great place for anyone in interested in the ecosystem or networking with dapp developers to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>ETHBerlin hackathon</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We assume if youâ€™re reading this document, that you know what ETHBerlin Zwei is, but to recap: ETHBerlin Zwei is a combination of a hackathon, experiences, workshops and talks, happening from 21st till 25th of August 2019 in Berlin, Germany.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Although we did not participated hacking at the ETHBerlin hackathon, there were quite big amount of other clever people there, which didn&#8217;t stayed unnoticed (our friends from AirGap got to win one of the prizes). </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aeternity Meetup</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the peak of the 10+days long event &#8211; Blockchain Week Berlin aeternity invited developers to join and meet at the Blockchain Embassy and talk blockchain, with beers and pizzas!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1545\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Philipp Piwowarsky &amp; Milen Radkov presenting at Aeternity Meetup Berlin</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Philipp and Milen did an Introduction to <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/build-your-first-decentralized-application-aepp-on-aeternity-blockchain-sophia-smart-contract-address-book/\">Sophia Smart Contracts</a> on Ã¦ternity.

Our goal is to build the next generation of browser extension wallets.  We have been working on the wallet for a few months already and we are grateful for the support of <a href=\"https://aeternity-ventures.com/\">aeternity ventures</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aeternity-foundation.org/\">aeternity foundation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/waellet/nnkfipoloblhgnahnaocfkhmmplcdneb\">waellet extension</a> is available in the Chrome Web Extension store.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What problem do we solve?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the team behind MetaMask has launched in July 2016, their browser extension managed to change the perception of the users as to how a cryptocurrency wallet should be. They made a &#8220;hot wallet&#8221; allowing you to use Ethereum based dApps directly in your browser. In addition one can store, send and receive ether and ERC-20 tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as the ecosystem is growing and we have more and more chains coming into the blockchain world, we feel that from a user&#8217;s perspective it is limiting to have access to only one network at a time. It is similar to having a bank card that is allowing you to pay for services in only one currency.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>We want to bring in the next step in the evolution of the browser extension wallets.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is our solution?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before wallets were mostly desktop applications making it very hard, user-unfriendly and unsafe to interact with the blockchain. This problem has been solved with the integration of the wallet into the browser /the browser extension wallet/.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using the existing technology as a stepping stone we started to envision a wallet that will bring even better user experience. Gone will be the times when the user will have to switch wallets so he can interact with dApps hosted on different blockchains.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does Waellet work? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We see Waellet as user&#8217;s first choice wallet when it comes to interacting with dApps hosted on different blockchains. Build around aeternity, Waellet is to become a tool that enables users to pay for different services without the need to worry about the network of the particular dApp &#8211; this will happen in a decentralized and cryptographic secure way through integration with the WeiDex &#8211; decentralized exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Waellet is still in beta and under heavy development. Last week we on-boarded three more people to work along with Milen, pushing to bring you our best vision of the wallet as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can download and try the <a href=\"https://waellet.com/\">waellet</a> but please use with caution as we have not reached a stable release yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/account_view.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1288\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=1288\" class=\"wp-image-1288\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/account_view.png 359w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/account_view-180x300.png 180w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/account_view-346x576.png 346w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px\" /><figcaption>Account view</figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/home_view.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1289\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=1289\" class=\"wp-image-1289\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/home_view.png 360w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/home_view-181x300.png 181w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/home_view-347x576.png 347w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /><figcaption>Home view</figcaption></figure></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a link to the <a href=\"https://github.com/waellet\">Waellet GitHub</a> repo for those of you who would like to dive into the code, raise an issue or give it a star ðŸ™‚</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More updates are coming soon&#8230; Stay tuned!!!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>We are proud to bring to your attention a project that we have been hard working recently with the aim of making the interaction with decentralized applications (dApps) more user-friendly.
