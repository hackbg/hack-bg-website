Today, blockchain is a widely spread idea that is poised to change the very face of many industries, businesses, and the exchange of data. Considering the benefits and security blockchain offers, tech-heads are trying to employ different ideas to remove the central authority and disrupt various industries, of course for their own benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What is Blockchain?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we look at which industries Blockchain has the biggest impact and is likely to drastically change, let&#8217;s take a glance at what Blockchain is all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A blockchain consists of a list of records known as blocks, which are linked to one another using cryptography forming a chain. Since each block comes with a cryptographic hash of the previous block, transaction data, and a timestamp, no data can be modified. This helps in recording transactions between two parties efficiently with better security and transactional transparency.&nbsp;The virtues of Blockchain technology lead to potential benefits including greater transparency, enhanced security, improved traceability, increased efficiency and speed of transactions, reduced costs, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain technology</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering these benefits and the security blockchain offers, it is most likely going to revolutionize many business sectors. But since there is no sure-shot of which industries will be disrupted and where organizations will fail,&nbsp;here are 5 industries that most likely to undergo a renaissance of their own:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Finance and Banking</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2400\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/@bermixstudio?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\">Bermix Studio</a> on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/coin?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Blockchain is particularly known from cryptocurrencies, it should be no surprise that the most common industry using blockchain, is banking and finance.&nbsp;According to a recent IBM survey, 91% of banks are investing in blockchain solutions, and 66% of institutions are expecting to be running at scale with blockchain. It seems that blockchain is finally poised to shake up financial markets in a way that will benefit both consumers and financial institutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every day, millions of transactions take place in the banking sector and blockchain can help in maintaining a secure system that keeps permanent records of these transactions. This not only lowers the risk with better security but enables faster and cheaper transfer thanks to the decentralization offered by blockchain. From making cross-border payments faster to removing the costly middleman it’s already impacting the international as well as domestic banking network. Implementing distributed ledger technology in the banking sector is a great step towards making banks more profitable and valuable as this ledger is distributed, published, and stored in multiple locations and when a transaction occurs, it is added to each copy of the ledger. Because there are many copies of the ledger, blockchain is practically immutable to hackers and frauds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that many advantages, come many use cases. Here are some of them:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cross-border transactions &#8211; Using digital currency based on blockchain technology, one can easily transfer tokens from one place to another, that too without the use of a third-party organization. Moreover, blockchain-powered payment processes can reduce transaction time to mere minutes, and that too with enhanced security, transparency, and affordability. The transaction costs are also reduced and take only a few hours to process and complete international transfers;</li><li>Trade finance platforms &#8211; create smart contracts between participants, increasing efficiency and transparency, and opening up new revenue opportunities;</li><li>Digital identity verification &#8211; When customer identifying information is secured using blockchain, banks can increase public trust while protecting against fraud and speeding up the verification process significantly;</li><li>Credit reporting &#8211; Blockchain-based credit reporting is more secure than traditional server-based reporting and may also enable companies to take non-traditional factors into account when calculating credit scores.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Undoubtedly, Blockchain technology has a lot to offer for the Financial and Banking industry. At a global level, blockchain is being considered by many as a solution to the multiple challenges banks are facing in settlement and clearing, collateral management, KYC, trade finance, or digital identities. With growing enthusiasm for future growth among the banking CEOs (77% of CEOs of banks worldwide), implementing disruptive technologies like blockchain is on the initiative&#8217;s agendas. That sounds promising, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about how <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain benefits the Financial sector</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Healthcare</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2721\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/national-cancer-institute-NFvdKIhxYlU-unsplash-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://unsplash.com/@nci?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">National Cancer Institute on Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s face it. The healthcare industry has been in need of a significant disruption when it comes to securing patient’s health records, lack of transparency in the pharmaceutical supply chain, lack of interoperability between databases holding patient health records, and dispersity of healthcare-related information, be it patients’ medical history or medical staff credentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the inherent security and decentralization, the benefits of blockchain in healthcare are numerous. That’s why blockchain technology is so important to the industry. It can revamp the trust by securely storing medical records that can be accurately and safely transferred to and accessed by the doctors and people who are authorized while eliminating the need for a central authority and enabling rapid access to data. It can improve the safety of patients’ electronic medical records, facilitates health data monetization, and enforces interoperability between healthcare organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another healthcare concern revolves around counterfeit medication and blockchain technology can control this, too. The problem is that, often, counterfeit medications are difficult to distinguish from real ones. Blockchain technology solves this problem by using supply chain management protocols where the medicine provenance can be traced, reducing revenue losses and guaranteeing patients safety. A BIR Research stated in a report titled “<a href=\"https://bisresearch.com/industry-report/global-blockchain-in-healthcare-market-2025.html\">Global Blockchain in Healthcare Market- Analysis and Forecast, 2017-2025</a>.” that “The most prominent beneficiaries of the technology will be the pharmaceutical companies, which lose approximately $200 billion to counterfeit drugs each year. By enabling complete visibility and transparency throughout the drug supply chain, blockchain will allow tracking of drugs to their point of origin and thus, help to eliminate falsified medication, reducing revenue loss by up to $43 billion annually for pharma companies,”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of healthcare organizations implementing Blockchain technology into their systems is rapidly growing. According to a<a href=\"https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/blockchain-market-in-healthcare\" class=\"rank-math-link\"> report</a>, the value of the blockchain market in the healthcare industry was $2.12 Billion in 2019 and estimated to reach $3.49 Billion by 2025. So there is nothing else to conclude except that the healthcare industry is among those that are about to be revolutionized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Checkout more on <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-healthcare/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain and Healthcare</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Supply Chain</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2723\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-225x300.jpg 225w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-432x576.jpg 432w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/arno-senoner-yqu6tJkSQ_k-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@tierramallorca?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Tierra Mallorca</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/supply-chain?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand how blockchain can transform the supply chain, let’s look at the challenges in the supply chain. Currently, the supply chain management system is plagued by a lack of efficiency and transparency and most networks face difficulties when trying to integrate all parties involved (suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers, auditors, and consumers) and the current model makes it difficult to maintain a consistent and efficient supply chain system &#8211; which impacts negatively not only the profitability of the companies but also the final retail price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Blockchain technology is all about decentralization, transparency, and immutability, there is high interest in how Blockchains might transform the supply chain and logistics industry and solve its problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subsequently, Blockchain can increase the efficiency and transparency of supply chains and positively impact everything from warehousing to delivery to payment. Most importantly, Blockchain provides consensus—there is no dispute in the chain regarding transactions because all entities on the chain have the same version of the ledger. All this leads to less time delays, less human errors, less costs, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is estimated that the global blockchain supply chain market size was valued at $ 93.16 million in 2017, and is projected to reach $ 9,852.91 million by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 80.2% from 2018 to 2025. Big industry giants like Unilever, Nestle, Tyson, and Dole are now implementing blockchain projects and solutions for tracking and guaranteeing the authenticity of their products. Walmart is another company that uses blockchain to keep track of its pork it sources from China and the blockchain records where each piece of meat came from, processed, stored, and its sell-by-date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more on how <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain can improve Supply Chain Management</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Real Estate</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"769\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-1024x769.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2724\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-1024x769.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-768x577.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-1536x1153.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-2048x1538.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/tierra-mallorca-rgJ1J8SDEAY-unsplash-767x576.jpg 767w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@tierramallorca?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Tierra Mallorca</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/real-estate?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional real estate has always been a sphere of business for the “well-resourced” individuals and organizations. Moreover, a real estate business is extremely prone to high levels of corruption and dishonesty. According to the United Nations, from 800 billion to 2 trillion USD dollars is laundered globally every single year, of which the biggest part comes from real estate operations. According to the estimates of the United Nations, this figure is in the region of $1.6 trillion per year. And that is not all, obstacles such as lack of transparency, lack of liquidity, realtor and banking fees, transaction speed, frauds, etc. are driving people away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology can have a significant impact on solving these challenges, as it has the ability to benefit enterprises as well as individuals in many ways. One of the biggest impacts of Blockchain on commercial real estate would be a smoother, faster contract management process, automation of real estate transactions, acceleration, as well as becoming more accessible. Lets see some more use cases:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Blockchain makes the transaction process more efficient and cuts costs &#8211; Blockchain technology can make transactions of real estate more efficient and less costly by reducing the number of intermediaries. Transactions facilitated on a blockchain can be made within minutes and cost only a fraction of its current price. Expensive intermediaries, such as real estate agents, appraisers, and notaries are cut out of the process.</li><li>Blockchain makes the real estate industry more transparent &#8211; Blockchain technologies’ immutable and decentralized nature can have a significantly positive impact on transparency within the real estate market and can assist in combating money laundering and tax evasion. Through blockchain technology, documents, and events during the purchase of a property can be tracked, contracts become readable, and registries cannot be changed afterward. Furthermore, it also establishes an all-encompassing overview of where investments come from and who the actual owner of a property is. As a result, it becomes more difficult for criminal organizations to launder illegally obtained money through the purchase of properties.</li><li>Blockchain makes real estate investments more accessible &#8211; Blockchain technology enables new ways to invest in real estate which benefits companies as well as individuals. Blockchain technology allows individuals and companies to purchase and trade only fractions of real estate, and in turn, enables fast and easy transactions of ownership. This creates liquidity and ultimately makes the real estate industry more accessible.</li><li>Tokenization &#8211; Tokenization refers to the securitization of digital assets. After an asset has been tokenized, it can be divided into more granular pieces, hence it becomes available to a larger audience. In the case of real estate, tokenization reduces costs of investments, allows fast and easy transactions, and provides liquidity in an otherwise slow-moving industry. Consequently, it enables more people to invest in real estate, also investors with only minimal available capital.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All these use cases lead to benefits like &#8211; Faster and more efficient processing of transactions, No manipulation of ownership, Low transaction costs, Low barrier to investing in real estate, Professional opportunities for the regular investment community, and many more</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering all those benefits blockchain offers for the real estate industry, it should be a matter of time to be implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more about <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-real-estate/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain &amp; Real Estate</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Insurance</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2725\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-768x513.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/scott-graham-OQMZwNd3ThU-unsplash-863x576.jpg 863w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@homajob?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Scott Graham</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/insurance?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The operational inefficiencies of the insurance industry are many: Loads of paperwork worsening the customer experience; complicated claims management presenting an operational nightmare for insurers; risks of fraud, lack of trust, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By switching to blockchain solutions, many opportunities lie ahead for the insurance industry.

Additionally, it is immutable and transparent. In some of our previous articles, we have looked in details into the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\">tech behind and the idea of blockchain</a>. Following the series of blockchain&#8217;s best use cases and disrupting industries with blockchain technology in this next article, we are going to explore how the healthcare sector can benefit from integrating blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Healthcare in numbers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthcare is a complex ecosystem composed of <em>Drug manufacturers</em>, <em>Medical equipment makers, Managed healthcare companies</em> providing health insurance policies and <em>Healthcare facility firms</em> operating hospitals, clinics, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Global spendings in healthcare all sectors combined:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2015 Global healthcare spending topping $7 trillion dollars</li><li>Expected to grow to over $8.734 trillion by 2020 and to over $10 trillion by 2025 </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> According to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bisresearch.com/industry-report/global-blockchain-in-healthcare-market-2025.html\">report by BIS research.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> &#8220;A global blockchain in the healthcare market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 63.85% from 2018 to 2025, to reach a value of $5.61 billion by 2025. The use of blockchain for healthcare data exchange will contribute the largest market share throughout the forecast period, reaching a value of $1.89 billion by 2025, owing to the use of blockchain to solve the most widespread problem in healthcare information systems related to interoperability and non-standardization that has created data silos in the industry.<em>”</em> </p><cite>* CAGR ( Compound Annual Growth Rate)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the current problems in the Healthcare sector?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4>Non-startartisation</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Data is the next big thing that is going to revolutionize public healthcare and more specifically how the data is recorded, stored, analyzed and shared. But the current systems, if existing, are inefficient because they are centralized (all information kept in one place), siloed and disjointed. Moreover, they are inefficient because they are not allowing for easy sharing of patients data outside of the host institution without exposing the data at a security risk. In addition, health data is hard to make sense of as it&#8217;s often times presented in different formats, according to industry experts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"mce_47\">Interoperability</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another problem putting patients health at risk caused by healthcare systems is the <em><strong>interoperability</strong></em> issue:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <strong>“Statistics show that up to one in five patient records are not accurately matched even within the same health care system. As many as half of the patient records are mismatched when data is transferred between healthcare systems.”</strong><br></p><cite> <br>Director of Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI), Shaun Grannis </cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>Data ownership and control</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Today patients information is not in their control.  This might have been accepted up until now but in the future patients might claim their right to have access to their personal information and to control it. At the current setting, their information is gathered and managed by their host institution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> Drug traceability</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Drug counterfeiting is a major problem in the pharmaceutical industry. According to the Health Research Funding Organisation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>10% to 30% of the drugs sold in developing countries are counterfeit</li><li>The counterfeit drug market is worth $200 billion annually</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> From a more economic perspective, drug counterfeiting represents an annual loss of 10,2 billion euros (11,23 billion USD) for the European pharmaceutical sector and 37.700 jobs are lost because manufacturers employ fewer people than they would if fake drugs didn’t exist. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How blockchain can solve those problems?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is still a developing technology but we can already see the huge impact that it has in various sectors and industries like <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\">Finance </a>and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\">Supply Chain</a>. Healthcare is just another example where we can see its implication:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <strong>The</strong>&nbsp;<strong>adoption of the blockchain technology could save the healthcare industry up to $100-$150 billion per year by 2025</strong>&nbsp;in data breach-related costs, IT costs, operations costs, support function costs and personnel costs, and through a reduction in frauds and counterfeit products. </p><cite>BIS report</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>According to pharma executives technologies are the one that are going to have the biggest impact on the industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"554\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-1024x554.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1211\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-1024x554.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-300x162.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-768x415.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-1038x562.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech.png 1244w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In its core blockchain is <strong>immutable</strong>, <strong>search-ready</strong> (big data and analytics), <strong>cryptographically protected</strong> (cybersecurity) and <strong>distributed system</strong> (cloud-like service). This is why blockchain is the perfect all-in-one solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new generation of blockchains is solving the<strong> standardization and interoperability </strong>issues by design. Allowing, via a specific protocol the communication between multiple blockchains. <em>This in the future will be crucial when dealing with different blockchain enabled solution for the healthcare industry.</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, blockchain also addresses the notion of <strong><em>data ownership and control</em></strong>. With the help of a smart contract (programable agreement), the patient can manage his data ( identifiable and non-identifiable) and share whatever he likes to share with whomever he likes to share it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recently written article, we have discussed the potential<a href=\"http://Blockchain can eliminate those risks by allowing end users to track each item origin with the help of IoT sensors.\"> </a><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\">use of blockchain in Supply Chain</a> and addressed the issue of <strong><em>drug traceability.</em> </strong>In short, we are reducing the possibility to buy a counterfeit drug by tracking the item with the help of IoT sensors and blockchain from the producer&#8217;s factory to our door. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the above mentioned problems, blockchain can also help the healthcare with payments and help to speed the verification of patient&#8217;s healthcare plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;<strong>Blockchain will become the next big healthcare technology innovation,</strong> particularly as it relates to payments and payer contracts. For example, in a situation when a health plan and patient are dealing with a contract, the blockchain can automatically verify and authorize information and the contractual processes. <strong>With transparency and automation, greater efficiencies will lead to lower administration costs, faster claims and less money wasted.&#8221; </strong></p><cite> <br>Bruce Broussard, president and CEO of Humana <br></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the payment process is automated in a <strong><em>trusted, transparent and verifiable</em></strong> way we will notice improvement of the whole process by reducing claim times and lowering administration costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having all information on a single platform is going to allow for deep analysis of population health and trends. Thus helping all parties to make more accurate planning and strategies, allowing them to deliver better, faster and more cost efficient services to the patients. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the next article about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hack.bg/category/blog/blockchain-and-business/\">Blockchain and Business</a>&nbsp;directly in your inbox subscribe to our newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great idea — but you don’t have the skill to build it – get in touch with us at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the full list of our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>We bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain&#8217;s Best Use Cases What is blockchain?
