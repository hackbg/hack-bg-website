If you have missed it you can check it <strong><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/lets-talk-blockchain/lets-talk-blockchain-vladislav-dramaliev-part-1/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Part 2 we are going to discuss the need for crypto in the world; the need for regulations; decentralization, Eth2.0, and more just keep reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Why do you think the world needs crypto? Or why not?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The world definitely needs crypto! One of the reasons is the fact that it provides an alternative to the current financial and banking system. It&#8217;s very early to determine if this alternative is successful, but so far, is doing quite well. I think crypto is changing the way people think about money, and what money is, what value is, how value is created or destroyed, and who or what controls it. I think crypto and blockchain enable to create new financial products more suitable for a high-tech society. I am certain that with open blockchain infrastructure&nbsp; banking and financial services will be automated and will become more transparent and more trustworthy. I think in the 21st century, it&#8217;s important to look at the technology on how it can solve issues and not just stick to systems that have remained unchanged for hundreds of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With blockchain technology, smart contracts, automation, and artificial intelligence, the world of finance, banking, and insurance could change dramatically in the next years for the benefit of the users. These services can reach parts of the globe, which currently don&#8217;t have access to banking and financial services. Of course, a lot needs to be done on scalability and UI?UX before that. But that’s coming. For the developed world, I believe public, permissionless blockchain technology is the only viable deterretto the dystopian futures that could be created by states or corporations. Blockchain technology and crypto is leverage against these constantly increasing powers. Of course, crypto enthusiasts&nbsp; don&#8217;t have an army yet, so we need to rely on soft power. But soft power is becoming increasingly important in the 21st century. So when I think about blockchain and crypto &#8211;&nbsp; they&#8217;re not trying to destroy the existing financial and banking services, but want to push them towards greater transparency, and make them evolve in a way. So I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a war between the two but more of a synergy that we are going to witness in the future. Still, if things don’t go the way we want them in the traditional finance and banking space, we can always fall-back to public blockchain platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Do you think that crypto projects need stricter regulations? In the crypto space, we always talk about decentralization, but still, someone has to be responsible?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very complex and important issue. I think the transparency aspect is more important here because crypto is more easily trackable and identifiable. There are, of course, practices that enable people to completely or at least, to a large extent, conceal their identities. I think the crypto space is kind of self-regulating. But since the crypto market cap is growing to trillionsof dollars (that&#8217;s not a small amount, but in comparison to the rest of the financial and banking space it&#8217;s not large) regulators will become more interested in it. So regulations are coming. For the larger part of humanity, regulations will actually open the doors to crypto, the minority of cyberpunks, maximalists, idealists and people who are looking into crypto in a more philosophical way, will also get what they want in terms of decentralization and the whole spirit of the technology, but I think there will be a compromise made on both sides &#8211; between those who don&#8217;t want regulation and the ones that want full regulation. I believe we will meet somewhere in the middle. This will be a positive development, depending on what exactly these regulations look like. Some of the proposed regulations that I&#8217;ve seen sound impossible to implement in practice. It&#8217;s very interesting to see how far that will go. In the EU the regulation around  crypto and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/defi-decentralized-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">DeFi</a> will be formed by legislation but also some interesting European Court of Justice rulings. So regulation is inevitable, like it or not. It might change the user experience, but at the same time, it might bring a lot more users to the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Do you believe in true &#8220;decentralization&#8221; and to what extent do you think it can be achieved?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think everyone&#8217;s focusing on decentralization, and this is not the point here. I think trustlessness is more of a key point. The ability to be sure that certain applications cannot be stopped or affected by anyone that is out there, and are functioning as they are supposed to be, without anyone being able to stop them or modify them. Decentralization is actually not a natural state in our physical world when it comes to how systems work. A direct example here is the competitive advantages in economics, and production at scale &#8211;&nbsp; it&#8217;s much more efficient to create a factory that creates a specific product. So in terms of efficiency, it&#8217;s much more adequate to be centralized and many systems are pushing in this direction. So what we are actually trying to do here is fighting against natural laws in order to achieve robustness. But I don&#8217;t think that pure decentralization can be achieved. We can see that even in Bitcoin, which is one of the most decentralized blockchain networks. There are four pools that produce more than&nbsp; 75% of the entire network. They are composed of individual miners, yes, but there is still centralization. The economic incentives keeping the network running are more important than decentralization. I like the decentralization aspect because of the existence of copies of the blockchain, that&#8217;s what makes it valuable. But apart from that, I don&#8217;t think decentralization is what keeps it running. I think the strong economic (game-theoretical) incentives that Bitcoin established are what’s protecting the network. I am, however, a fan of <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Proof of Work</a> and still believe it is the better <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Sybil attack mechanism</a> in comparison to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Proof of Stake</a>. PoW connects the blockchain with the real-world via the conversion of energy into crypto, while PoS relies only on questionable economic incentives. I don’t like losing that real-world connection, but that’s where most of the altcoin projects are heading. Let’s see how that will go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What do you think about Eth2.0 and what do you think makes it better than other platforms on the market?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>That is also a controversial topic. Everyone was looking forward to <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">ETH2.0</a>. It looks like it might be one of the best well-protected solutions because of the whole amount of Ether that is currently being staked in order to be mined. But, let&#8217;s see how it goes. It&#8217;s going to be the first major implementation &#8211; the proof of stake. I think it will be a process before we really make it robust and move away from the proof of work chain. What makes it good is just the fact that <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Ethereum</a> in general is a brand that is one of the best-known names in the technology world and is just second to Bitcoin. It has a huge amount of dev resources behind and it has institutional support and the Ethereum ecosystem is unlike any other solution out there. From a technological point of view, I really can&#8217;t say I haven&#8217;t looked into the details. And even if I have, I&#8217;m just a marketing guy, and I heavily rely on the opinions of other people. But keeping in mind how many years it has been working, and how many devs are actually working on it. I believe that it might be a success. I&#8217;m still not convinced that proof of stake is really the best technology out there and I also don&#8217;t think that Ethereum is currently the best technology out there. But it&#8217;s still the most popular so it enjoys the largest network effect. That is a guess again. The best technology does not always win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>It has recently been talked about the long-awaited Tapoot and Schnorr signatures in the Bitcoin space, do you think this is a step forward in favor of privacy and scalability for Bitcoin? What do you think about Bitcoin upgrades?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think those upgrades are very important and I am waiting for them impatiently, to be honest. They will make the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/running-full-bitcoin-node-over-tor-on-ubuntu/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Bitcoin network</a> more efficient without increasing the block size, and also make it more private. And this privacy is actually the part that I&#8217;m most interested in because I think Bitcoin requires more privacy. On the other hand, we have witnessed that some privacy coins were delisted by exchanges. So it&#8217;s interesting to see how that will work. What I think will happen is that some people will use the privacy-preserving features of the Bitcoin network, but exchanges and other big economic actors won&#8217;t. So in effect, the Bitcoin network will functionally be divided into a formal public and private-public network. . This will be the best way forward because if all transactions are private, large economic agents participating in the Bitcoin ecosystem will have a harder time serving users. But definitely, there should be some straightforward solution for privacy without resorting to mixer services. So all upgrades to the Bitcoin network are welcome. And of course, they need to be implemented very carefully, because we don&#8217;t want to lose any trust in the network. It&#8217;s very important to keep the Bitcoin network robust and well-secured.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What advice would you give to people who are just entering the Blockchain space, whether as users or developers?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, as users, I always give the advice to do some research and get some crypto. Even small amounts will push you further down the rabbit hole. You&#8217;ll start looking at charts more frequently, then you&#8217;ll be reading the news more frequently,&nbsp; at your position 24 times a day. Are you in profit? Are you at a loss? What are the reasons behind that and so on. That’s how you get hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for developers? Well, what can I say, it would be an interesting time for them. Because you know, <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/defi-decentralized-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">decentralized systems</a> are very different from centralized ones. The processes of developing, upgrading, and securing them are different. But definitely, I think this technology will be fundamental in the future. And I think blockchain will be in some form behind most of the banking and financial transactions after 5 to 10 years, unless something more efficient, or something more secure, manages to attract a large developer resource and liquidity. But again, as I said, it&#8217;s not always the best technology that wins, but the technology that most people are using. So join us in the blockchain space. It&#8217;s one of the most exciting spaces in 2021. It&#8217;s super-fast-paced. The scale and speed of innovation is just mind-boggling. And yeah, it&#8217;s never ever dull, so join the fun and get future-proofed.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In Part 1 of our interview with Vlad, we talked about Blockchain and DeFi projects, the current bull-run, and more.

A passionate Blockchain enthusiast, Founder and Director of <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-bithope-foundation\">The BitHope Foundation</a> (the first Bitcoin crowdfunding platform in Europe), Co-Founder and Community Lead at <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Sofia-Crypto-Meetup/\">Sofia Crypto Meetup</a>, and Marketing Manager at <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://mettalex.com/\">Mettalex</a>. In this first part of our interview, we talked about the recent bull-run, the DeFi space, some interesting blockchain projects, and more. See what his opinion on these topics was:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How would you explain Blockchain to someone who never heard of the technology?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The way I explain Blockchain is &#8211; a distributed database copied 1000s of times, and whenever someone wants to make an edit or a change in that database, all of the other databases are notified and need to be updated as well. These changes to the database are governed by a set of rules also called consensus protocol. These rules are enforced by cryptography (laws of physics). <br><br>Currently, blockchain&#8217;s most viable and widely spread use is in the financial sector. Blockchain is used to store information about who owns what and any updates to this database are translated into transactions of changes of ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first blockchain database is actually <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/running-full-bitcoin-node-over-tor-on-ubuntu/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Bitcoin</a> and we have seen that Bitcoin has been functioning very well without any major issues for more than 12 years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What interesting projects have you encountered? What problems do they solve and in which areas are they most often linked to?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned Blockchain technology is most developed in the financial sector. You can store any type of information, but large files are expensive to store on a public blockchain. You cannot store videos, photos or even small files, but you can store their hashes and follow or monitor if any changes to have been made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can store unfalsifiable information about anything that has happened in the past via hash-based timestamps. This has numerous applications, for example, supply chain management where you can be certain about the lifecycle of a product thanks to the consecutive time-stamping by different supply chain participants along the product’s journey from raw material to the final product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another useful case is record-keeping by storing hashes of documents. When a specific version of a document has been first introduced, and you can check if it has been changed afterwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the blockchain system as the ultimate source of truth about a number of different questions like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Who owns what?</li><li>Who owned what?</li><li>When an action was done and by whom?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is a new type of technology that enables truth-keeping. And that’s at the core of our civilization!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What are the differences between the previous Bull-Run in 2017 and the recent jump in cryptocurrency prices?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the previous bull-run was provoked primarily by ICOs, causing a very high demand for Ether and Bitcoin, in particular, and that&#8217;s why the price of these two currencies really increased.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of other coins increased as well because there was a lot of hype around Bitcoin and Ethereum. Everyone was looking for the “next bitcoin” and ICO teams were promising users fantastical applications. The narrative was that basically any problem can be solved with a blockchain. Which is definitely not true. Furthermore, the infrastructure was nowhere near ready for 95% of all the decentralized apps that were promised. Back then the bull-run was primarily caused by retail investors, regular guys with small amounts of money, who were looking to make a quick buck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the ICO extravaganza was a prerequisite for decentralized finance (DeFi) to develop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The difference now is that technology has matured significantly. There are many use cases that can be realistically realized (and are being realized). There is also DeFi on Ethereum</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as a brand name, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are much more known and much more trusted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real change that happened in 2020 was the outbreak of the Corona Virus pandemic, which caused economic devastation around the globe. That led to uncertainty and excessive printing of money. Central banks are just increasing the monetary supply to levels that we have never seen before. This pushes investors to move away from fiat, due to inflation expectations. That’s one of the main reasons that push investors into cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin because they. Bitcoin has existed for more than a decade and hasn’t had any major hacks or glitches, it&#8217;s the first cryptocurrency, it’s the first blockchain, it&#8217;s robust and it&#8217;s the most secured one. In 2020, it proved that rules that were set in the protocol back in 2009, when the system launched, continue to be perfectly executed 11 years after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, it&#8217;s very limited. There will ever be just 21 million bitcoins and 20% of them are lost or locked forever. So, there is a very limited supply of this digital asset that could be sent all around the globe for a few satoshis, irrespective of what amount is being sent. People or companies can transfer millions or even billions in bitcoin for a couple of cents/dollars in transaction fees and can store them quite effortlessly without the risk of falsification. A bitcoin cannot be faked. Unlike, for example, Gold, which is a pain to transport, secure and has been faked for thousands of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>In your opinion, does the recent jump in the price of bitcoin fundamentally affect the technology itself and people&#8217;s interest, or is it just hype?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I think there are a lot of fundamental reasons why the price is rising. As I mentioned, Bitcoin is a unique asset, a new asset class, that retail, investors with big pockets, corporations, and financial institutions are considering for portfolio diversification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve also witnessed its price history in the last 12 years and the fact that it has performed phenomenally. And it&#8217;s this limited supply feature that is essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is definitely not only hype. The world is going high-tech. Fiat currency is collapsing. Whole economies are in tatters. Users are fleeing to scarce assets. Bitcoin’s enormous advantage is that it has solved digital scarcity, making it extremely suitable for the digital age and highly useful to high-tech new generations.&nbsp; There is an element of hype, of course, because people are looking at the price going up, and they&#8217;re FOMOed about it but there are a lot of fundamentals under that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What is your opinion about the DeFi space and are there any projects that you find interesting and encouraging?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think a large audience of investors both retail and institutional are discovering the DeFi space. I&#8217;m super bullish about it as well. I believe that it is the logical continuation of the Bitcoin idea. It is definitely not “De” yet, but we are getting there. It is impossible to solve decentralization for such complex applications too quickly. Currently, the Defi ecosystem is well-developed primarily on Ethereum, but I think due to the high gas fees, DeFi ecosystems are being developed on other platforms and more advanced infrastructure as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think ecosystems on other chains will develop and they will also converge. The next big and interesting thing, which will come to DeFi, is to follow how regulations will affect the space. Currently logging in with just a Web 3 wallet, it&#8217;s great, the onboarding is quick but this will have to change at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to see how DeFiusers will react to any KYC and AML. There are a number of solutions there that I like in this respect like <a href=\"https://www.yoti.com/\">YOTI</a>. I think this need for KYC/AML in DeFi will push the development of self-sovereign identity solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some projects I&#8217;m interested in &#8211; Aave, Uniswap, UMA, Compound (I&#8217;ve entered in DeFi through it). I was using Compound to generate an interest rate on a deposit in USDC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very interested in L2 solutions such as Optimism, Matic, Polkadot, ZK-Rollups. I would like to see how this will work in the real world, and also keen to see if Uniswap V3 will integrate with Optimism. I believe this could be a game-changer because currently the gas fees are just crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course I&#8217;m interested in <a href=\"https://mettalex.com/\">Mettalex</a> &#8211; the project I&#8217;m currently involved in. It aims to build a decentralized commodity derivatives exchange. We believe that all assets are moving on-chain and would like toWe bring new commodity markets to the DeFi space. This will enable speculators to short or longSteel, Zinc, Lithium Carbonate, Natural Gas, Iron Ore, spreads like BTC/Gold, BTC/Oil, and even sDEFI/sCEX. We are constantly researching what new markets users may be interested in. But actually, users will be able to create markets themselves. Mettalex also enables liquidity providers (LPs) to supply stablecoins to Mettalex’s Autonomous Market Makers and be rewarded in trading fees and governance tokens. This is actually one of the unique features of Mettalex &#8211; 87.5% of all MTLX tokens will be distributed to liquidity providers in a period of 8+ years. No ICO/IEO, no whales, no large team and advisers distribution. The tokenomics logic is similar to that of Bitcoin where miners who provide utility to the network get rewarded with new bitcoins. In the case of Mettalex &#8211; the utility is liquidity, and the rewards are in MTLX tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another unique part about Mettalex is that it is trying to solve real-world issues for physical commodity holders. Those are medium and small-sized enterprises that are dealing with the actual commodities themselves in the physical world &#8211; we are providing them with a low-cost hedging solution so they can manage risks in a cost and capital-efficient way. The project is Cambridge, UK-based and the Founder and CEO &#8211; Humayun Sheikh, is very experienced in the tech sector and in trading commodities. He actually was a founding investor in DeepMind which was later bought by Google for $500m. Mettalex is a spin-off of <a href=\"https://fetch.ai/\">Fetch.ai </a>which is focusing on developing advanced blockchain infrastructure, decentralized AI-based oracles, and a global internet-of-things economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What are the steps to be followed for a successful project in the blockchain space?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very interesting question and at the same time it’s a very hard one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The people that are best suited to successfully implement/create projects in the DeFi space are often developers who have an economic or financial background. Because the core of decentralized finance is a kind of crossover between finance, technology, and blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So apart from having the skills, you&#8217;ll have to have a great design and marketing team to get the word out. Currently, it&#8217;s very noisy in the DeFi space, because many different companies are out there, trying to promote their products, fighting for liquidity. It&#8217;s a super competitive field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very core though, you need to get the tokenomics, which actually refers to the game-theoretical incentives, right. This goes back to economics and getting the token economics right (most DeFi defy projects are featuring tokens). So it&#8217;s essential to get the tokenomics right. You have to also be careful how you go to market, how you promote your product, how you distribute the tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also have to listen to the community very closely and make sure their reasonable requests are met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What could help is to have a background in finance and/or trading, in the real financial world, or experience in a company that&#8217;s finance or banking-focused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surely, the team and the experience of its members are of paramount importance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you need to make as much as possible to audit the code well and avoid any loss of trust. That’s the most valuable resource in the crypto/DeFi space (and actually in the real-world). Once you lose it, it is hard to get it back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>If an investor is looking for a Blockchain development company to partner with to run his project, what are the criteria for making the choice? What to look for?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s pretty straightforward. The development company should have a good track record of working with other projects and be proficient with Solidity, and all the application-level languages like Javascript, Python, GO, and Java. Having built various SDKs and Middleware-types of software is a big plus since it means that the company is aware of fundamental blockchain principles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe it&#8217;s important to get acquainted with what projects have these companies developed and worked on before. Some of them are consultants as well. So they need to be able to consult the client on what is the best solution, what fits them, and if this specific solution requires a blockchain at all. Most clients are not very versed in the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s also important how quickly certain products can be delivered. And of course, the cost is very important for many. Standard stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the company is a one-stop-shop with marketing services, community services, content services, and everything this could be also useful, but might be a bit controversial, because it&#8217;s good for the company to be focused on one thing or a few things only. The larger it becomes the more slowly it moves and the less innovative it becomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve read so far then you liked what Vlad has to say about the blockchain and DeFi space.

Setup SSH</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are using a VPS or other cloud machine which you can access via SSH, or your machine already has SSH enabled you can skip this step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"http://ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a> 20.04 LTS Desktop and Server come without SSH service enabled by default, which we need to be able to access remotely our machine, but you can easily enable it by just one command.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt-get install openssh-server</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This command will install <a href=\"http://www.openssh.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">OpenSSH</a>, which provides free SSH connectivity tools and supports all SSH protocol versions. OpenSSH encrypts all the traffic to eliminate possible eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: The default port for SSH is 22, but you can configure it to run on a port of your choice by editing the config file at <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>, and apply the changes by restarting the service <code>sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have UFW firewall running on your machine, you will need to allow incoming SSH connections. Type the following command:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo ufw allow ssh</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After running it you should see the output below.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Output\nRules updated\nRules updated (v6)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: If you changed the default SSH port (22) to a custom port, you will need to open that port instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if your ssh daemon listens on port&nbsp;<code>4242</code>, then you can use the following command to allow connections on that port:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo ufw allow 4242/tcp</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Once we are setup with the SSH configuration we can proceed to the real deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>02. Install packages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to install some packages needed for compilation of bitcoin&#8217;s source code.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade\nsudo add-apt-repository universe</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible this is already added, so you might see something like <code>'universe' distribution component is already enabled for all sources.</code> If so &#8211; just ignore it and proceed further.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libtool pkg-config libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libevent-dev doxygen libzmqpp-dev libdb++-dev</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>03. Install BerkelyDB</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin Core is still using BerkleyDB 4.8.30 because of backward compatibility. Using a newer versions makes the wallet incompatible with older versions, making downgrade impossible (or at least difficult).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can do this manually by downloading it via `wget`.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>wget http://download.oracle.com/berkeley-db/db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Then verifying the hash of the file:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>echo '12edc0df75bf9abd7f82f821795bcee50f42cb2e5f76a6a281b85732798364ef db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz' | sha256sum -c</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Extracting the archive:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>tar -xvf db-4.8.30.NC.tar.gz</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Configure and build the BerkleyDB for unix</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>cd db-4.8.30.NC/build_unix</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>mkdir -p buildBDB_PREFIX=$(pwd)/build../dist/configure --disable-shared --enable-cxx --with-pic --prefix=$BDB_PREFIX</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>make install</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The above may fail with an error similar to this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>In file included from ../dist/../dbinc/mutex_int.h:12, from ../dist/../dbinc/mutex.h:15, from ./db_int.h:884, from ../dist/../cxx/cxx_db.cpp:11: ../dist/../dbinc/atomic.h:179:19: error: definition of ‘int __atomic_compare_exchange(db_atomic_t*, atomic_value_t, atomic_value_t)’ ambiguates built-in declaration ‘bool __atomic_compare_exchange(long unsigned int, volatile void*, void*, void*, int, int)’ 179 | static inline int __atomic_compare_exchange(</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>If so you will need to apply some patches for C++11 which are required for the build. The developers at bitcoin have provided a nice shell script which does the downloading, verification and installation of those automatically here <code>https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/install_db4.sh</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can fetch and run it like so:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/master/contrib/install_db4.sh\nchmod +x install_db4.sh\n./install_db4.sh .</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After few minutes you should see a message including <code>db4 build complete.</code> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also see some more info about flags which you should use for compiling bitcoind (don&#8217;t worry if you did not copy those &#8211; you will find them below).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>04. Compile Bitcoin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to compile bitcoin, we first need to clone the source code repository from Github. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We want to checkout a version tag so we don&#8217;t run into problems, building from the <code>master</code> branch, as there the developers are constantly pushing new code.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>cd bitcoin\ngit checkout v0.21.0\ngit status</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After checking out the release tag and running the status check you should see this message:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>HEAD detached at v0.21.0\nnothing to commit, working tree clean</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time for us to build the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>./autogen.sh</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>export BDB_PREFIX='${BDB_PREFIX}'\n./configure BDB_LIBS=\"-L${BDB_PREFIX}/lib -ldb_cxx-4.8\" BDB_CFLAGS=\"-I${BDB_PREFIX}/include\"</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>make\nmake check\nsudo make install</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We now have successfully compiled bitcoin! 🚀🔥🎉</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>05. Configure Bitcoin to use Tor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"block-38be3746-3589-4fa3-a065-8cd02e28d84d\">Before staring syncing the blockchain history we need to configure some settings for our bitcoin node.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"block-38be3746-3589-4fa3-a065-8cd02e28d84d\" class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>cd ~\nmkdir .bitcoin\ntouch .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf\necho \"txindex=1\" >> .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up <code>txindex=1</code> will make Bitcoin rescan the whole blockchain and rebuild the whole database. This can take several days depending on your hardware and internet connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Tor is properly setup in our system bitcoind will be able to communicate to other nodes over Tor network, otherwise it will default for communication over TCP. As we care about our privacy we want to explicitly forbid communication over TCP and allow it to only use Tor. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>echo \"onlynet=onion\" >> .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Setup a maximum number of inbound + outbound connections the node can use, so it does not drain your bandwidth.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>echo \"maxconnections=20\" >> .bitcoin/bitcoin.conf</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As already mentioned the initial bitcoin blockchain download takes few days to weeks and using Tor will make this time longer as the Tor network is a bottleneck. One reason for that is due to low-bandwidth volunteer-operated Tor routers, but with wider adoption and volunteers running nodes this will change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing Tor on Ubuntu is pretty straightforward and easy:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo apt install tor</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>After the installation is complete we need to check the configuration and ensure we have all of these configurations in <code>/usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc</code></p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>ControlPort 9051\nCookieAuthentication 1\nCookieAuthFileGroupReadable 1</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To view the file we can use <code>less</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>less /usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In case any of those configuration settings is missing, use `echo` to add it to the file:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo sh -c \"echo 'ControlPort 9051' >> /usr/share/tor/tor-service-defaults-torrc\"</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"block-38be3746-3589-4fa3-a065-8cd02e28d84d\" class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">If you did edit the file, make sure to restart the Tor service:</pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo /etc/init.d/tor restart</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Next step is to allow <code>bitcoind</code> to access to Tor, by adding it to that user group. Replace <code>username</code> with the Ubuntu account username you are operating under.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>sudo usermod -a -G debian-tor username</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally we can launch Bitcoin over Tor: 🙌🥳</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bitcoind -daemon</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>We can follow the logs and monitor progress of the node syncing using <code>tail</code>:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>tail -f ~/.bitcoin/debug.log</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Fetching <code>getnetworkinfo</code> should result in IPv4 and IPv6 flags set to <code>false</code> and Tor to `true`. This will ensure us that we are operating our node privately.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, after the sync, we can use <code>bitcoin-cli</code> for querying information for the network status, connections and transaction and blocks information. Get peer info:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bitcoin-cli getpeerinfo | grep true</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspect a raw transaction:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction 0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>And inspect the raw output:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>01000000010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000ffffffff0704ffff001d0104ffffffff0100f2052a0100000043410496b538e853519c726a2c91e61ec11600ae1390813a627c66fb8be7947be63c52da7589379515d4e0a604f8141781e62294721166bf621e73a82cbf2342c858eeac00000000</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-26b33e98-5d62-4b3f-901c-2970218ead0e\">References and resources</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/install_db4.sh \" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/install_db4.sh</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18846 \" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/18846</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/depends/packages/bdb.mk#L17 \" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/depends/packages/bdb.mk#L17</a></li><li><a href=\"https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/79758/bitcoin-built-with-a-newer-berkeley-database-incompatible-with-a-older-wallet \" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/79758/bitcoin-built-with-a-newer-berkeley-database-incompatible-with-a-older-wallet</a></li><li><a href=\"https://8bitcoin.medium.com/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-full-node-over-tor-on-an-ubuntu-linux-virtual-machine-bdd7e9415a70 \" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://8bitcoin.medium.com/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-full-node-over-tor-on-an-ubuntu-linux-virtual-machine-bdd7e9415a70</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch03.asciidoc \" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/blob/develop/ch03.asciidoc</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4y7nc3/create_bitcoin_full_node_with_tor_step_by_step/?st=j5n7z1q1&amp;sh=392084c9\" class=\"rank-math-link\">https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4y7nc3/create_bitcoin_full_node_with_tor_step_by_step/?st=j5n7z1q1&amp;sh=392084c9</a></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>00.

Along with the usual dev update that we care to provide for the convenience of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_194546-e1567177032206-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1572\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_194546-e1567177032206-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_194546-e1567177032206-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_194546-e1567177032206-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Milen Radkov Dev news update</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Interesting news in the blockchain space among others was the announcement of the Avalanche’s Snowball consensus algorithm, proposed by Emin Gün Sirer at web3summit. The novelty is the way the consensus is done.  The nodes are randomly asking other nodes about their opinion, and building up their own confidence in their opinion vs other&#8217;s opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statebox is building a formally verified process language using robust mathematical principles to prevent errors, allow compositionality and ensure termination. In addition, the language is visual and allows one to inspect the flow of the program as it is executing. These properties make Statebox suitable for distributed systems, blockchains, workflow management systems, application orchestration, and system architecture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Ethereum dev space we have seen:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Synthetix released a new category of Synths this week &#8211; Index Tokens.

His aim was to answer a bunch of important questions that we developers have to consider before getting started with the implementation of an actual solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_195604-e1567177287128-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1573\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_195604-e1567177287128-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_195604-e1567177287128-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_195604-e1567177287128-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Rali Ralev &#8211; WeiDex<br></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin is the King of crypto. But is Bitcoin really suitable for accepting payments? What is the best way to do it? What are the challenges? Those are a few of the questions that Rali was answering during his presentation. For those of you who missed we are going to answer them one by one here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into more details, Rali sent some chills in the public by sharing his view that Bitcoin is just a Hipster&#8217;s tool for payments :). Some of the arguments where that currently Bitcoin has been mostly used for speculation and rarely to buy stuff. One of the reasons might be that most retailers are having bad rates when accepting Bitcoin. For example, a product purchased in BTC could cost 20% higher if purchased in USD. Another cornerstone of the problem could be the transaction time. Rali also claimed that there are probably more pictures of the famous &#8220;Accepting Bitcoin&#8221; sticker circulating on the Internet than actual transactions on the bitcoin network. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202129-e1567177470863-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1574\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202129-e1567177470863-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202129-e1567177470863-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202129-e1567177470863-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>blockchain developers meetup</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what has been said, Bitcoin is still used by some retailers to accept payments. Rali&#8217;s work experience led him to implement solutions in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first solution would be to use a third party service. According to Rali it is relatively easy to integrate a solution that is providing an easy way to convert BTC to your local currency. The convenience is that you don&#8217;t have to care about confirmation time and you don&#8217;t have to manage a wallet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawbacks are the high fees, the lack of control over your funds and the fact that you can be tracked. Additionally, if you are a service requiring multiple simultaneous transactions, you can easily hit the Gap limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This solution could be ideal for small businesses with low transaction volume and low technical teams willing to accept Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second solution discussed by Rali was the use of pre-generated addresses. The advantage is the user is keeping control over his public and private keys. However the use of many addresses can slow down the wallet&#8217;s operations. According to our speaker, this solution is ideal for fast prototyping and for exchanges.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202143-e1567177584386-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1575\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202143-e1567177584386-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202143-e1567177584386-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202143-e1567177584386-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>blockchain dev meetup Q|A</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The third and last option will be to generate addresses on-demand, notably the most recommended and scalable solution to use if you are tech-savvy.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To conclude his talk Rali have to the public his recommendation on wallets and resources, mentioning about Bitcoin core wallet, Electrum daemon and Mastering Bitcoin, the book of Andreas Antonopoulos. Tools that can help you to develop your solution to accept Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Audio and screen recording coming soon!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join our <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Blockchain-Developers-Meetup-Bulgaria/\">meetup group</a> to stay tuned for our next event!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Our blockchain developers meetup went as usual on the last Thursday of the month.
