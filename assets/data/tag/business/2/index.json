We came to the conclusion that the main benefit of using blockchain technology is to achieve <strong>trust.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*qCfB1Rs_TejfX9bm\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mmckee30?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mitch Mckee</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the previous post, we concluded that trust is essential for making business and its the essence of blockchain tech, so using blockchain is beneficial for attracting new customers and partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we are going to discuss whether you should do an ICO or an STO to power your existing business or finance your new business idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ZktwoqxtvERrzPes\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rawpixel</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s first explain what is ICO and what is STO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ICO stands for <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/ico-initial-coin-offering/\">Initial Coin Offering</a> and as many of you had heard it was the main way for non-existing projects to gather an impressive amount of money during those last few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all started with Ethereum raising money to develop its platform, the one that has become the main platform to make ICO&#8217;s on. The peak was sometime in the middle of last year with projects like Tezos and FileCoin raising as much as 250 millions of dollars from individual investors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*li78tZhCpfoqOgA8\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@blankerwahnsinn?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Fabian Blank</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though many of the projects failed to deliver the expected products, either due to lack of technology developments (the main issue being scalability) or by simply disappearing with bags full of money (a.k.a. SCAM) the <strong><em><g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">ICOs</g> are an “Effective way” to crowdfund your project if rules are followed </em></strong><em>as stated recently by </em>Jay Clayton, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

But what is STO?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>STO stands for Security Token Offering and the main difference to the ICO is that the tokens are <strong>Security Tokens</strong>, backed by something tangible like the assets, profits, or revenue of the company. To put it in another way, only accredited investors can participate in the offerings. Their funds are protected by the law and the investors are getting either a part of the company (shares) or part of the company&#8217;s profits (dividends).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*pFPj1Nd3IiOr7E2G\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rawpixel</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Securities laws are well developed and defined in most of <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">the countries</g>. Thus, Security Tokens would inherit a well build legal framework and structure that would support token buyer rights, protect them from <g class=\"gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-del replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"7\" data-gr-id=\"7\">the unfortunate</g> situations and set their expectations right. However, secondary trading and liquidity are comparatively reduced for these tokens, as securities can&#8217;t be traded as freely as the Utility Tokens since securities are subjected to many country-specific restrictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Th5k_Ex7QrrKM6VR\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rawpixel</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>To wrap it up &#8230; <br></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>ICOs are a great way to deliver a <strong>utility token</strong> that will power your business by allowing the early &#8220;supporters&#8221; of your idea to use your services at a reduced price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>STOs are an alternative way to raise money by offering <strong>security tokens, </strong>which are seen as shares of your company, giving rights to dividends or part of your company to the investors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which of both to chose to boost your business depends on your business plan but clearly any of the above can bring you the fresh capital that will allow you to grow your business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great idea — but you not sure if blockchain technology can be integrated into your business, Get in touch with us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full list of our services could be found on our website at <a href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://hack.bg/#services</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We<em> bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In the previous post of this series on how to boost your business with blockchain, we were discussing the fundamentals of blockchain tech.

Questions regarding blockchain technology and how your business can benefit from it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of this post, you should be able to decide whether to integrate blockchain to your business or not, regardless if you are a successful business or in the idea stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>What is blockchain?</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5r4U6AAgFHb_rlYf\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@clintadair?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Clint Adair</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially blockchain is a distributed ledger, a peer to peer network, where every peer has all the information about the network and nobody can lie about the state of the network.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If somebody tries to cheat, the network is going to verify the information via its verification process ( consensus algorithm) and if the peers agree that the person is trying to cheat they will not include the information in the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to notice that nobody can change the previous records, one can only add new records to the chain. This is why we say that the blockchain is immutable and we can <strong>trust </strong>its records.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put it in a simple way, since we know that no one can cheat the network by saying I&#8217;m having zillions of dollars, the peers can trust each other. So <strong>trust </strong>is the first essential part of the blockchain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*sDXH7_MALP5UNkgC\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rawpixel</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part is <strong>transparency. </strong>Yes, you got me right, the blockchain is transparent. At early years many told that they can pay with Bitcoin and nobody will be able to track them down the road but nowadays we know that it is not a fact but an uninformed assumption.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*wUGptLcpvK72VqJ9\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@oliverschwendener?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Oliver Schwendener</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The third essential part is of blockchain technology is&nbsp;<strong>traceability.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since everything on the blockchain is linked, hence the block-chain, one can easily track things moving on the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*MeudmeZpOlYjTTtp\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@eberhardgross?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">eberhard grossgasteiger</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Just to wrap up the first important part of this article. The blockchain is a new type of accounting ( known as triple accounting ) and its main advantage over the previous type of accounting is <strong>Trust, Transparency, and Traceability.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>2.<strong> Ok, I got why blockchain is cool but is it a right fit for my company?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you answer with <em>yes</em> to the following question, then most likely your company can benefit from integrating blockchain technology into your business process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Is your company dealing with things that the customers/ partners need to </em><strong><em>trust </em></strong><em>you about?&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should your customers or partners trust you with their funds, the origin of the products you supply them with or simply the fact that you have the number of stocks that you are promising to ship by the end of the day?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your customers/ partners can trust you without even knowing you then they might decide more easily to do business with you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*OiIeloYdaRR-mMVI\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rawpixel?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">rawpixel</a> on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>3. How can I boost my business with blockchain?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you have seen trust is essential in business and trust is an essential element of the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrating blockchain to your business process is building trust, trust brings new customers and your business is growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beside integrating blockchain technology into your business, you can think of boosting your business with an ICO (initial coin offering) or an STO (security token offering).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/ico-initial-coin-offering/\">What is ICO</a> and what is STO you can learn in details in my next post.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great idea — but you not sure if blockchain technology can be integrated into your business, Get in touch with us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full list of our services could be found on our website at <a href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://hack.bg/#services</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong><em>bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Part 1 Many business owners are asking me, what can we do with blockchain?&nbsp; It is so because blockchain has become a buzzword that we hear from everywhere.
