What are the benefits? How to develop them and what are they good for? <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milen Radkov had prepared for us some exciting presentation. Let&#8217;s find out!<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those of you who could not attend we would like to give you the meetup plan. This time we had 2 parts. On the first <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">part</g> we <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">talked</g> how things in Polkadot work in theory and on the second part we focused on the code and the tools that are doing the magic.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started with the well know to all blockchain developers Smart Contracts functions. When we think about it &#8211; it is really cool that one can write a dApp and push it to the network without permission, knowing that this app will live “forever” without worrying that somebody is going to change his logic, but we all know that the current solutions are not perfect. We are also limited by the computational complexity and the price that we have to pay for it. Not to mention that your code is good to go forever but only on one chain.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p> So what are the alternatives? </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And why are we excited to follow the development of projects like Polkadot.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>In Polkadot transactions are unmetered /so you can have extremely complex state transition functions and never have to think about running out of gas/</li><li>Parachains are like building your own blockchain and not have to think about security, because of the shared security mechanism that Polkadot provides</li><li>One can trust the Polkadot validator set that they are securing the chain</li><li>Interoperability &#8211; you can message between all the different <g class=\"gr_ gr_9 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"9\" data-gr-id=\"9\">parachains</g> /message passing/ async</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second part of the meetup, we deep dived into the code to discover the advantages of using Polakot and Substrate. For those of you who are new to Polkadot, Substrate is a framework allowing us to build entirely new blockchain only in few commands, stepping up on Polkadot&#8217;s development and helping us developers to focus on our business logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-721\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DSC_0564-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Substrate module example</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>During the code review, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/milen_radkov\">Milen</a> showed us how quick it is to run a custom <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">parachain</g> with a simple betting game ruining on it.

And as we can see the team has come a long way in a very short period of time. In only thirteen months the team managed to deliver over 68,000 lines of core code and more than 100k lines altogether. They have launched several testnets each of them to support and test all new features. <br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Present</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><g class=\"gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"7\" data-gr-id=\"7\">Currently</g> the team has been working on 1.0 beta of the third generation of <g class=\"gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"6\" data-gr-id=\"6\">blockchain</g> technology stack, Substate. Another cool thing that Polkdot&#8217;s team has been working on is the release of “Alexander” test net. The team is considering this their third major milestone. “Alexander” test net is important because it&#8217;s going to feature the audit-ready GRANDPA finalization algorithm, an overhaul to the cryptography and further improved governance logic including lock-voting and delayed-enactment.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the previous development the team is already ahead of schedule but <g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">nevertheless</g> there is one more key milestone to reach: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ICMP or, to the uninitiated, Inter-Chain Message Passing. scheduled to happen over the first three months of 2019, with a test net incorporating it, scheduled to be launched in April. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"678\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-575\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2062-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption> Milen Radkov talking at polkadot sofia</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Simultaneously, the team has been <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">finalising</g> the “nominated proof-of-stake” scheme and building in <g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">parachain</g> consensus into Substrate, allowing Substrate chains to plug <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">in to</g> the global blockchain network that is Polkadot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this is done and the key features are implemented, there’s going to be a period of around six months of extensive testing before we can see the launch of Polkadot 1.0.
