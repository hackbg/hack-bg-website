Participants will also understand how to apply State Channels and Oracles to develop real-world applications that solve both business and social problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The workshop will be held on 7th June 2019 at Room M1</em></strong> and will be divided into two sessions: one in the morning (starting\nat 11:00), and another in the afternoon (starting at 15:00), each featuring two\ntracks:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Track\n1: æternity Theoretics (45 mins)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first session will feature a brief introduction to blockchain technology, shifting to an introduction to æternity’s protocol, architecture, features, and mechanics. Participants will learn about <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contract </a>programming with Sophia ML, how to use Oracles for real-world data integration, and State Channels for scalability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Track\n2: Building on æternity (2hours)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of the workshop will be dedicated to a practical exercise in which participants will learn how to set up the development environment and initialize projects using æternity’s Dev Suite. Participants will gain first-hand experience in writing a <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/building-voting-aepp-with-sophia-ml-on-aeternity-blockchain/\">simple æpp with Sophia ML</a>, familiarize themselves with the interface, and delve deeper into building æpps on the platform. The track will expose participants to State Channels, smart contract initialization, and execution, and teach them how to implement lists in states, create structures, define and implement logic, test smart contracts, and make use of Oracles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here\nis the workshop schedule:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Session 1</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>11:00 &#8211; 11:15 &#8211; Welcome coffee<br>11:15 &#8211; 12:00 &#8211; æternity Theoretics<br>12:00 &#8211; 13:00 &#8211; Lunch<br>13:00 &#8211; 15:00 &#8211; Building on æternity</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Session 2</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>15:00 &#8211; 15:15 &#8211; Welcome coffee<br>15:15 &#8211; 16:00 &#8211;  æternity Theoretics<br>16:00 &#8211; 16:05 &#8211; Break<br>16:05 &#8211; 18:00 &#8211; Building on æternity</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The æternity team welcomes all curious\ndevelopers to a journey of exploration of the vast æternity Universe!\nRefreshments will be provided during the workshop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come and find out why æternity’s\ninfrastructure is the best solution to the demands of any decentralized\napplication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prerequisite for participation at this workshop is a valid ticket for the <a href=\"https://events.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress/tickets/\">WeAreDevelopers World Congress </a>2019.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Experience State Channel Technology First-Hand—Join the æternity Development Crash Course!
