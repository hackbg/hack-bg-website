We share them all over our channels and groups, but for those who do not follow regularly &#8211; this is what was new during the last month:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Truffle released new version <a href=\"https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle/releases/tag/v5.0.13\">v5.0.13</a> – decoder improvements</li><li>Ganache with new release <a href=\"https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache/releases/tag/v2.0.1\">v2.0.1</a></li><li>Embark &#8211; new beta <a href=\"https://github.com/embark-framework/embark/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#410-beta0-2019-04-17\">4.1.0-beta.0</a> </li><li><a href=\"https://truffleframework.com/teams\">Truffle Teams</a>, zero-configuration continuous integration for Eth code</li><li><a href=\"https://medium.com/zokrates/building-identity-linked-zksnarks-with-zokrates-a36085cdd40\">ZoKrates v0.4.4</a> – building identity-based snarks. adds BabyJubJub</li><li><a href=\"https://devpost.com/software/zexe-on-ethereum\">ZEXE on Plasma</a> from Edcon hackathon</li><li><a href=\"http://waellet.com\">Waellet</a> &#8211; aeternity browser extension released first initial beta</li><li>Easily <a href=\"https://github.com/status-im/status-chat-widget\">embed a Status chat room</a> in your website</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tricks and tips</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We talked a lot about gas optimization via variables packing, deployment gas optimization, and other interesting tricks. Here&#8217;s some of the tricks and tips we covered:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Any non-trivial contract will have errors in it. Your code must, therefore, be able to respond to bugs and vulnerabilities gracefully.</p><cite><br>Prepare for failure</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8211; Write clean, consistent good code (If you repeat certain operations often, make them a function)<br>&#8211; Move logic to Libraries if appropriate (They are published separately)<br>&#8211; Use modifiers for common checks<br>&#8211; Do as little as possible in the constructor</p><cite>Lowering deployment cost</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"672\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/modifiers_can_be_inefficient.png\" alt=\"Solidity modifiers can be inefficient\" class=\"wp-image-1116\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/modifiers_can_be_inefficient.png 672w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/modifiers_can_be_inefficient-300x169.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 672px) 100vw, 672px\" /><figcaption>Solidity Modifiers can be inefficient</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When you add a function modifier, the code of that function is picked up and put in the function modifier in place of the _ symbol. This can also be understood as &#8220;The function modifiers are inlined&#8221;. In normal programming languages, inlining small code is more efficient without any real drawback but Solidity is no ordinary language. In Solidity, the maximum size of a contract is restricted to 24 KB<br></p><cite>Modifiers can be inefficient</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The recording will be available soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TVFNkjoSnhkPvirgi02CrW7_lLdkwBANr5OYV6TQ1Hs/edit?usp=sharing\">Presentation</a></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Last week we had our monthly blockchain developers meetup.
