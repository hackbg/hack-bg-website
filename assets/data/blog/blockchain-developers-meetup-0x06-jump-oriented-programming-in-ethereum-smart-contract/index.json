We got out focus on the last minute postponed Constantinople Ethereum fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Constantinople Ethereum fork postponed</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As it turns out <a href=\"http://chainsecurity.com\">Chain Security</a>, a company focused on research and security of smart contracts, found a vulnerability that might result <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Grammar multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">to</g> bigger issues and re-enabling <g class=\"gr_ gr_67 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling\" id=\"67\" data-gr-id=\"67\">re-entrancy</g> attacks on some smart contracts after the fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fork.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-592\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fork.png 488w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/fork-300x157.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 488px) 100vw, 488px\" /><figcaption>fork</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Summarizing this &#8211; <a href=\"https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1283\">EIP1283</a> which is introducing cheaper gas costs <g class=\"gr_ gr_163 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"163\" data-gr-id=\"163\">for </g><code>SSTORE</code><g class=\"gr_ gr_163 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"163\" data-gr-id=\"163\"> operations</g> may result in reentrancy vulnerability for some smart contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Contracts that increase their probability to being vulnerable are contracts that utilize a <em>transfer()</em> or <em>send()</em>  function followed by a state-changing operation. An example of such a  contract would be one where two parties jointly receive funds, decide on  how to split said funds, and initiate a payout of those funds.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>And the brief explanation: The issue is that when a <code>CALL</code> is made to transfer funds, even if the caller hasn&#8217;t specified additional gas, will spend 2300 gas. <g class=\"gr_ gr_268 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"268\" data-gr-id=\"268\">Solidity&#8217;s </g><code>.transfer()</code><g class=\"gr_ gr_268 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"268\" data-gr-id=\"268\"> function</g> does this and provides no option for the user to override that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this has not been an issue previously, because even though with 2300 gas the caller could make a <code>CALL</code> from the callee<g class=\"gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"20\" data-gr-id=\"20\">,</g><g class=\"gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"20\" data-gr-id=\"20\">but</g> there was no way to change a storage entry <g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\">when </g><code>SSTORE</code><g class=\"gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"4\" data-gr-id=\"4\"> costs</g> 5000 gas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now after Constantinople and the EIP-<g class=\"gr_ gr_35 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"35\" data-gr-id=\"35\">1283</g> the <g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\">cheapest </g><code>SSTORE</code><g class=\"gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_disable_anim_appear Style multiReplace\" id=\"5\" data-gr-id=\"5\"> operation</g> is 200 gas, which opens up a non-zero possibility of <g class=\"gr_ gr_3 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace\" id=\"3\" data-gr-id=\"3\">re-entrancy</g> attacks on some smart contracts.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jump Oriented Programming in Ethereum<br></h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2250-1024x678.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-590\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2250-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2250-300x199.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2250-768x509.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2250-870x576.jpg 870w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Exploiting Acoraida Monica game</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As the title suggests it &#8211; the whole topic that we went through is quite catchy. We initially saw this thing called Jump Oriented Programming in Ethereum last month, is quite well explained in a couple of great videos by LiveOverflow in his YouTube channel. So we got in touch with him and Milen Radkov presented this at the meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We saw how we can make a Solidity smart contract misbehave, making it acting different, hiding what exactly is it doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole thing is based on carefully selected function names, and specifically chosen address in order for the execution to succeed (in this case making it possible to withdraw and drain the whole contract).<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Resources</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/LiveOverflow/21c8a505ca176e5bb20bc94eb23acdf1\">Github repo with all the example code</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozqOlUVKL1s&amp;t=1s\">LiveOverflow video part one</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfL3FcnVbJg\">LiveOverflow video part two</a></li><li>video recording of the meetup coming soon</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Useful links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://meetup.com/blockchain-developers-meetup-bulgaria\">Blockchain Developers Meetup</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg\">Website</a></li></ul>\n","featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/DSC_2246.jpg","altText":"Blockchain Developers Meetup - 0x06 Jump Oriented Programming in Ethereum Smart Contract","mediaDetails":{"width":4928}},"categories":[{"id":"5","title":"Events","path":"/category/events/"},{"id":"71","title":"Meet-ups","path":"/category/meetups/"}],"tags":[{"id":"70","title":"Assembly","path":"/tag/assembly/","count":2},{"id":"26","title":"Blockchain Development","path":"/tag/blockchain-development/","count":10},{"id":"12","title":"Ethereum","path":"/tag/ethereum/","count":11},{"id":"42","title":"Meetup","path":"/tag/meetup/","count":17},{"id":"14","title":"Solidity","path":"/tag/solidity/","count":6}],"author":{"name":"Milen Radkov","path":"/author/milen/"}}},"context":{}}
