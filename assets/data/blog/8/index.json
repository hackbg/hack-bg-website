As you would guess‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääits similar to the traditional Initial Coin Offering (ICO), but leaving the token sale be handled by an exchange.

Some of the points made are also valid for Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) and we recommend them all to take the points into consideration before incorporating IEO as part of their features and services.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-caption\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/8c998-1cfIYEPtDUrSDq9ho3XuBWQ.png\" alt=\"\"/><figcaption>Initial Exchange Offering (IEO)‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPros vs&nbsp;Cons</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Starting with the&nbsp;CONS:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The IEO would be limited to an certain exchange, making it annoying for some investors to participate if they do not own an account in the same exchange. This requires additional KYC procedure and account verification approval time&nbsp;‚Ä¶ which leads to the second con</li><li>Also almost any exchange requires KYC, so this is very inconvenient for lots of investors.</li><li>In security matter this approach for funding a project adds an additional point of failure (the exchange).</li><li>Running an Initial Exchange Offering you stumble upon a fundamental problem‚Äî a high number of coins are in the possession of very few people, which leads to risk of price manipulations.</li><li>It‚Äôs quite easy for big investors to manipulate the price of the token.</li><li>On a traditional centralized exchange, one do not own his private keys, and with exchanges making asset transfers internally (most of them, if not all, are doing this) with no transaction on the blockchain‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich leaves the investor with tokens that he does not truly own.</li><li>Scammy projects would definitely want to do an IEO so your token could be listed on an exchange (so its easy for you to dump the coin after the crowdsale).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>The very few PROS of running an&nbsp;IEO:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Its easier for the project to be listed on an exchange.</li><li>IEO adds, in the manner of speaking a sort of protection layer for the investor, as the token is already listed on an exchange. So in case the founders decide to disappear, there is still a chance for the investor to sell off his tokens *(if there is any demand).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>In resolution I think the traditional ICO and IEO fundrasing models are somewhat ‚Äúbroken‚Äù along the way and not fitting for a serious decentralized project.
