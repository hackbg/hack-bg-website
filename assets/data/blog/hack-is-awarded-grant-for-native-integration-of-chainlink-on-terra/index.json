Their team is dedicated to the development and integration of Chainlink as the standard decentralized oracle framework used by smart contracts across any blockchain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://terra.money\">Terra Protocol</a> aims to create a programmable algorithmic stablecoin available on every blockchain. The project was created by a partnership of 15 large Asia-based e-commerce companies that focuses on building efficient, scalable, competitive programmable payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Terra Protocol ecosystem features numerous leading DeFi applications including Mirror Protocol, which allows users to mint synthetic assets that track real-world assets such as US equities. With native support for Chainlink oracles, Terraâ€™s ecosystem of DeFi applications such as Mirror will gain access to the most trustworthy source of external data.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>We are very pleased to announce that we have been selected as a recipient of a blockchain integration grant for [&hellip;]</p>\n","link":"https://hack.bg/blog/partnerships/hack-is-awarded-grant-for-native-integration-of-chainlink-on-terra/","modified":"2021-03-28T18:46:06","featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/chainlink-hack-terra.png","altText":"","mimeType":"image/png","mediaDetails":{"width":1920,"height":1080}},"categories":[{"id":"6","title":"Partnerships","path":"/category/partnerships/","count":3}],"tags":[{"id":"13","title":"Blockchain","path":"/tag/blockchain/","count":57},{"id":"170","title":"Chainlink","path":"/tag/chainlink/","count":1},{"id":"174","title":"CosmWasm","path":"/tag/cosmwasm/","count":1},{"id":"171","title":"Grant","path":"/tag/grant/","count":1},{"id":"172","title":"Oracles","path":"/tag/oracles/","count":1},{"id":"173","title":"Terra","path":"/tag/terra/","count":1}],"author":{"name":"Milen","path":"/author/milen/"},"metadata":{"postAudioId":["855c95ff0448f960e743e97e24c54e2dfa201880"],"mediumPost":["O:11:\"Medium_Post\":11:{s:16:\"author_image_url\";s:75:\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/fit/c/400/400/1*uTloDoy725Hwdw-PyJg0Yw.jpeg\";s:10:\"author_url\";s:26:\"https://medium.com/@radkov\";s:11:\"byline_name\";N;s:12:\"byline_email\";N;s:10:\"cross_link\";s:3:\"yes\";s:2:\"id\";s:12:\"8e18c68e4cfa\";s:21:\"follower_notification\";s:3:\"yes\";s:7:\"license\";s:19:\"all-rights-reserved\";s:14:\"publication_id\";s:12:\"6c324f156ae9\";s:6:\"status\";s:5:\"draft\";s:3:\"url\";s:39:\"https://medium.com/@radkov/8e18c68e4cfa\";}"],"postViewsCount":["46"],"rankMathFocusKeyword":[],"rankMathTitle":[],"rankMathDescription":[]}}},"context":{}}
