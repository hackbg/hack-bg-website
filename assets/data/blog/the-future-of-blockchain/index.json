And what is so special about blockchain?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> Traditionally, institutions such as banks, governments, and corporations have played the role of managing risk to facilitate trade and commerce. Now, for the first time, organizations can use technology to manage this risk to lower uncertainty and reduce everyday transaction costs of doing business. </p><cite>Cisco Report</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"728\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/infographic_01-1.png\" alt=\"digital economy in blockchain\" class=\"wp-image-821\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/infographic_01-1.png 728w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/infographic_01-1-300x99.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px\" /><figcaption>Statistics from Cisco&#8217;s report on digital economy</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>From the before mentioned report, we also learn that that blockchain market is expected to grow to 9.7 billion by 2021.
