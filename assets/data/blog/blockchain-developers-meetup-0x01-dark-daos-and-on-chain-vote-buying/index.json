So we’ve made our research, and found very interesting posts and proposals about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d like to thank all researchers and scientists that are looking very deeply into the matter, because this would have not been possible without their hard work.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The presentation was very interesting and we’ve covered the main key issues about it:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is a DAO?</li><li>How does a DAO work?</li><li>What is the difference between a DAO and a traditional top-down hierarchical company?</li><li>Vote buying issues in the traditional in-face voting</li><li>Voting on the blockchain — the issues it solves and the issues that occur using blockchain</li><li>Possible attacks and vulnerabilities of voting conducted on the blockchain.</li><li>Trusted hardware</li><li>What is a Dark DAO and how it can be used for vote buying, manipulation and fraud?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve recorded the session, so it’s available for later watching and for others that could not made it to be on time.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Watch the session here: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DFdD8qibFi4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div><figcaption>Dark DAOs and on-chain vote buying &#8211; 0x01 [Blockchain Developers Meetup]</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, here are the slides: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EN4RIqARuUrhkpoNJVo5u9QZnHRCC3vN/view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EN4RIqARuUrhkpoNJVo5u9QZnHRCC3vN/view\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EN4RIqARuUrhkpoNJVo5u9QZnHRCC3vN/view</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve received good feedback, so we are planning on holding the next meetup later this month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are <strong>interested in talking</strong> on some cool topic, or you want to <strong>propose some topic</strong> to be discussed — just <strong>drop us a line at </strong><a href=\"mailto:events@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-href=\"mailto:events@hack.bg\"><strong>events@hack.bg</strong></a> or write down a comment / reply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you all for joining and hope to see you again next time!</p>\n","featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/2de40-1nf2869v0rWgzeGjDCyiVNw.png","altText":"blockchain developers meetup 01 - onchain vote buying and dark daos","mediaDetails":{"width":800}},"categories":[{"id":"5","title":"Events","path":"/category/events/"},{"id":"71","title":"Meet-ups","path":"/category/meetups/"}],"tags":[{"id":"13","title":"Blockchain","path":"/tag/blockchain/","count":43},{"id":"30","title":"DAO","path":"/tag/dao/","count":1},{"id":"16","title":"Decentralized","path":"/tag/decentralized/","count":2},{"id":"34","title":"Events","path":"/tag/events/","count":7},{"id":"42","title":"Meetup","path":"/tag/meetup/","count":17}],"author":{"name":"Milen Radkov","path":"/author/milen/"}}},"context":{}}
