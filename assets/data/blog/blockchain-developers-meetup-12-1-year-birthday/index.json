We wanted to have an event that will celebrate the growth of our community, and bring value for those participating in it. So we decided to gather in a casual meetup with more social interaction and networking.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/blockchain_developers_meetup_12_2-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1510\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/blockchain_developers_meetup_12_2-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/blockchain_developers_meetup_12_2-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/blockchain_developers_meetup_12_2-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Blockchain Developers Meetup 12</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It was party time, and parties are always much more fun with more people, so this time we decided we had a joint event together with Sofia Crypto Meetup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is vacations season but still, we counted more than 30+ people, which made it a great first-year birthday. Thank you and thank our great host from <a href=\"http://networking.space\">Networking Premium Coworking</a> spaces which were not only hosting us but prepared balloons and decoration for the party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>P.S. Its not a developers meetup without pizzas, chips, beers, and pickles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/blockchain_developers_meetup_12_3-e1565253129147-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Blockchain Developers Meetup 12\" class=\"wp-image-1508\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/blockchain_developers_meetup_12_3-e1565253129147-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/blockchain_developers_meetup_12_3-e1565253129147-225x300.jpg 225w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/blockchain_developers_meetup_12_3-e1565253129147-432x576.jpg 432w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption>Blockchain Developers Meetup 12</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>And last but not least, as promised at the event opening, I&#8217;m sharing a list of blockchain developers news and updates for the month:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blockchain Developers Digest</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"Ethereum\">Ethereum</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ethereum 4 years birthday &#8211; the anniversary of the genesis block</li><li>Client releases<ul><li>Geth v1.9.1</li><li>Ethereum on ARM: new NanoPC-T4 and Raspberry Pi images with new supported devices and Prysmatic Eth2 client and VIPnode support</li></ul></li><li>Developers related<ul><li>Solidityâ€™s SMTchecker now supports multi-transaction checks and unbounded loops</li><li>web3js stable release.
