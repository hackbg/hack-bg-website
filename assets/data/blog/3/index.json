In this article, we are going to explore the benefits of blockchain technology in the gaming industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gaming in numbers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As per recent reports, the gaming market currently represents the largest segment of the global digital content industry (bigger than movie and music industries combined), generating billions of dollars in revenues annually and attracting an extremely wide audience. Gaming is also considered to be one of the business areas in which blockchain technology is being implemented most rapidly.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"782\" height=\"697\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report.png\" alt=\"2018 Global Game Market - Per device &amp; segment with year-on-year growth rates\" class=\"wp-image-1346\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report.png 782w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report-300x267.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report-768x685.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/global_games_market_report-646x576.png 646w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px\" /><figcaption>Infographics: Â© hack | Data: Global Game Market Report from newzoo</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a Newzoo report, global gaming revenues for 2018 were around $134.9 billion, 10.9% more than for 2017. Just to put it in perspective, digital distribution channels (marketplaces) account for most of these revenues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that mobile games are a primer and act as the key growth driver in the gaming industry, with a projected growth rate of 12.8% for 2018, taking that segment to $63.2 billion. At the same time, the forecast for overall retail sales of games is only $12.4 billion, or 9% of the whole industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Blockchain application in Gaming Industry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p> The intersection of blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and gaming is presenting real growth potential for both blockchain and gaming.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-1024x388.png\" alt=\"Blockchain application in Games\" class=\"wp-image-1351\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-1024x388.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-300x114.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-768x291.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/blockchain_gaming_hack_nintendo-1038x394.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Blockchain application in Games</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Background</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The game that marks the beginning of the blockchain gaming is <a href=\"https://huntercoin.org/\">HunterCoin</a>.  Released in February 2014 as a live experimental test to see how blockchain technology could handle full on game worlds. The purpose of the game was to collect HUC coins, human mining, but due to its fame, when the number of players grew the blockchain started to experience processing and speed issues.  This is mainly due to the fact that the game was running on a bitcoin fork (not suitable for applications that need to scale). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017 was released one of the most famous blockchain games build on Ethereum, CryptoKitties. In short, it is a game of digital collectibles allowing the player to collect (buy), breed and sell different (unique) types of virtual cats.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"620\" height=\"340\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto-kitties.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1360\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto-kitties.jpg 620w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto-kitties-300x165.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" /><figcaption>Crypto Kitties</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Marketplaces</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Games and game items are available at marketplaces. Currently, there are both types of marketplaces, centralized and decentralized. What are the limitation and the advantages of using any of those?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The context</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The worldâs largest centralized marketplace for virtual goods (OPSkins), is having millions of users, billions of items listed, and trading volumes estimated to be over $46 billion. The platform job is to maintain the transactional trust between the users and to prevent fraud by maintaining huge personnel to ensure the smooth running of the platform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how good the service of a centralized platform (marketplace) is, centralized platforms are limiting users on the way the platform can be used and on the way they transact with each other. Settlements cost them high fees and the transfers are taking a long time to execute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a decentralized marketplace, problems like fraud, transactional settlement, and international payments transactions are handled via smart contract ensuring cheap, fast, secure and transparent service.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Smart Contracts</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the other hand, decentralized platforms can use smart contracts to allows the facilitation and enforcement of a virtual asset transaction that guarantees the fulfillment of an operation (buy/sell) without requiring the interference of a centralized party, ensuring the correctness of the transaction (regardless whether it is an item or a monetary value).</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies-1024x576.png\" alt=\"CryptoZombies - blockchain based game\" class=\"wp-image-1354\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/crypto_zombies.png 1031w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>CryptoZombies &#8211; blockchain based game</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Asset transfers</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"5d3b\">Multiplayer Games Have LOTS of&nbsp;Items</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Runescape has 35,000 and World of Warcraft, the king of MMOs has over 100,000 different items! Shooters like Overwatch and Team Fortress 2 each have thousands of skins and items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tokenization</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most exciting aspect of decentralized virtual goods exchanges is the ability to tokenize virtual goods. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we can see in the above example there are thousands of game items that can be tokenized and traded. But when a player dedicates of his time and money to play a game (develop a hero) he is left with nothing when he deletes the game as all of the information about his game was stored on the company&#8217;s servers.  Now with blockchain, the player can not only claim and keep his virtual assets but he can also transfer/sell it to other players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of  game assets hosted on the blockchain is that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> Transactions and their history is easy to track (transparency)</li><li>No one can steal your asset, as long as you keep your privet key secure </li><li>Assets can be traded without the need for intermediary service</li><li>Assets can be easily transferred from one gamer to another. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Better security, as well as new opportunities and incentives for gamers, are just some of the benefits that blockchain can bring to our virtual pastimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a 50+ billion virtual goods market, we believe that this is extra motivation for players to claim control and ownership of their virtual goods. This could result in motivation increase, hence more user engagement and more revenues for the game development companies.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>In game purchases</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another evident application of blockchain in games is the integration of cryptocurrencies that can be used for in-game purchases. Global in-game spending is expected to reach 32 billion U.S. dollars in 2020, up from 22 billion U.S. dollars in 2015.                         </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this sense, cryptocurrencies can be used as a link between the internal economy of the game and that of the real world. They can be transferred and traded for other cryptocurrencies or fiat money via build-in decentralized exchanges or even centralized party exchanges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, using blockchain in game development can help create more unique objects and artifacts making them more valuable and more desirable. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Building trust</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past couple of years, games have begun to use blockchain features such as wallets and tokens to secure ownership of game artifacts. Blockchain can also ensure the authenticity of an asset with its inbuild trust and transparency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the other hand, players looking to buy a virtual item can be sure about its authenticity because the items are recorded on the blockchain, further developing trust between buyers and sellers and thus stimulating more transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, we can say that blockchain-based, open-source, decentralized systems will make the gaming experience more secure and transparent, guaranteeing fair conditions for all members. The decentralized gaming platform is bringing in technologies that will ensure user satisfaction, add value to virtual assets, and probably expand the size of the virtual gaming market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great ideaâââbut you donât have the skill to build it â get in touch with us at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the full list of our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>We bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In previous articles, we have discussed the fundamentals of blockchain technology.

Our goal is to build the next generation of browser extension wallets.  We have been working on the wallet for a few months already and we are grateful for the support of <a href=\"https://aeternity-ventures.com/\">aeternity ventures</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aeternity-foundation.org/\">aeternity foundation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/waellet/nnkfipoloblhgnahnaocfkhmmplcdneb\">waellet extension</a> is available in the Chrome Web Extension store.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What problem do we solve?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When the team behind MetaMask has launched in July 2016, their browser extension managed to change the perception of the users as to how a cryptocurrency wallet should be. They made a &#8220;hot wallet&#8221; allowing you to use Ethereum based dApps directly in your browser. In addition one can store, send and receive ether and ERC-20 tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as the ecosystem is growing and we have more and more chains coming into the blockchain world, we feel that from a user&#8217;s perspective it is limiting to have access to only one network at a time. It is similar to having a bank card that is allowing you to pay for services in only one currency.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>We want to bring in the next step in the evolution of the browser extension wallets.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is our solution?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before wallets were mostly desktop applications making it very hard, user-unfriendly and unsafe to interact with the blockchain. This problem has been solved with the integration of the wallet into the browser /the browser extension wallet/.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By using the existing technology as a stepping stone we started to envision a wallet that will bring even better user experience. Gone will be the times when the user will have to switch wallets so he can interact with dApps hosted on different blockchains.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does Waellet work? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We see Waellet as user&#8217;s first choice wallet when it comes to interacting with dApps hosted on different blockchains. Build around aeternity, Waellet is to become a tool that enables users to pay for different services without the need to worry about the network of the particular dApp &#8211; this will happen in a decentralized and cryptographic secure way through integration with the WeiDex &#8211; decentralized exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Waellet is still in beta and under heavy development. Last week we on-boarded three more people to work along with Milen, pushing to bring you our best vision of the wallet as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can download and try the <a href=\"https://waellet.com/\">waellet</a> but please use with caution as we have not reached a stable release yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"359\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/account_view.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1288\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=1288\" class=\"wp-image-1288\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/account_view.png 359w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/account_view-180x300.png 180w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/account_view-346x576.png 346w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 359px) 100vw, 359px\" /><figcaption>Account view</figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"360\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/home_view.png\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1289\" data-link=\"https://hack.bg/?attachment_id=1289\" class=\"wp-image-1289\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/home_view.png 360w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/home_view-181x300.png 181w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/home_view-347x576.png 347w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" /><figcaption>Home view</figcaption></figure></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is a link to the <a href=\"https://github.com/waellet\">Waellet GitHub</a> repo for those of you who would like to dive into the code, raise an issue or give it a star ð</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More updates are coming soon&#8230; Stay tuned!!!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>We are proud to bring to your attention a project that we have been hard working recently with the aim of making the interaction with decentralized applications (dApps) more user-friendly.

Additionally, it is immutable and transparent. In some of our previous articles, we have looked in details into the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\">tech behind and the idea of blockchain</a>. Following the series of blockchain&#8217;s best use cases and disrupting industries with blockchain technology in this next article, we are going to explore how the healthcare sector can benefit from integrating blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Healthcare in numbers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Healthcare is a complex ecosystem composed of <em>Drug manufacturers</em>, <em>Medical equipment makers, Managed healthcare companies</em> providing health insurance policies and <em>Healthcare facility firms</em> operating hospitals, clinics, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Global spendings in healthcare all sectors combined:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>2015 Global healthcare spending topping $7 trillion dollars</li><li>Expected to grow to over $8.734 trillion by 2020 and to over $10 trillion by 2025 </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> According to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bisresearch.com/industry-report/global-blockchain-in-healthcare-market-2025.html\">report by BIS research.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> &#8220;A global blockchain in the healthcare market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 63.85% from 2018 to 2025, to reach a value of $5.61 billion by 2025. The use of blockchain for healthcare data exchange will contribute the largest market share throughout the forecast period, reaching a value of $1.89 billion by 2025, owing to the use of blockchain to solve the most widespread problem in healthcare information systems related to interoperability and non-standardization that has created data silos in the industry.<em>â</em> </p><cite>* CAGR ( Compound Annual Growth Rate)</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the current problems in the Healthcare sector?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4>Non-startartisation</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Data is the next big thing that is going to revolutionize public healthcare and more specifically how the data is recorded, stored, analyzed and shared. But the current systems, if existing, are inefficient because they are centralized (all information kept in one place), siloed and disjointed. Moreover, they are inefficient because they are not allowing for easy sharing of patients data outside of the host institution without exposing the data at a security risk. In addition, health data is hard to make sense of as it&#8217;s often times presented in different formats, according to industry experts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 id=\"mce_47\">Interoperability</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another problem putting patients health at risk caused by healthcare systems is the <em><strong>interoperability</strong></em> issue:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <strong>âStatistics show that up to one in five patient records are not accurately matched even within the same health care system. As many as half of the patient records are mismatched when data is transferred between healthcare systems.â</strong><br></p><cite> <br>Director of Center for Biomedical Informatics (CBMI), Shaun Grannis </cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>Data ownership and control</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Today patients information is not in their control.  This might have been accepted up until now but in the future patients might claim their right to have access to their personal information and to control it. At the current setting, their information is gathered and managed by their host institution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4> Drug traceability</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Drug counterfeiting is a major problem in the pharmaceutical industry. According to the Health Research Funding Organisation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>10% to 30% of the drugs sold in developing countries are counterfeit</li><li>The counterfeit drug market is worth $200 billion annually</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> From a more economic perspective, drug counterfeiting represents an annual loss of 10,2 billion euros (11,23 billion USD) for the European pharmaceutical sector and 37.700 jobs are lost because manufacturers employ fewer people than they would if fake drugs didnât exist. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How blockchain can solve those problems?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is still a developing technology but we can already see the huge impact that it has in various sectors and industries like <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\">Finance </a>and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\">Supply Chain</a>. Healthcare is just another example where we can see its implication:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <strong>The</strong>&nbsp;<strong>adoption of the blockchain technology could save the healthcare industry up to $100-$150 billion per year by 2025</strong>&nbsp;in data breach-related costs, IT costs, operations costs, support function costs and personnel costs, and through a reduction in frauds and counterfeit products. </p><cite>BIS report</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>According to pharma executives technologies are the one that are going to have the biggest impact on the industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"554\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-1024x554.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1211\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-1024x554.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-300x162.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-768x415.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech-1038x562.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/pharmaTech.png 1244w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In its core blockchain is <strong>immutable</strong>, <strong>search-ready</strong> (big data and analytics), <strong>cryptographically protected</strong> (cybersecurity) and <strong>distributed system</strong> (cloud-like service). This is why blockchain is the perfect all-in-one solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new generation of blockchains is solving the<strong> standardization and interoperability </strong>issues by design. Allowing, via a specific protocol the communication between multiple blockchains. <em>This in the future will be crucial when dealing with different blockchain enabled solution for the healthcare industry.</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, blockchain also addresses the notion of <strong><em>data ownership and control</em></strong>. With the help of a smart contract (programable agreement), the patient can manage his data ( identifiable and non-identifiable) and share whatever he likes to share with whomever he likes to share it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recently written article, we have discussed the potential<a href=\"http://Blockchain can eliminate those risks by allowing end users to track each item origin with the help of IoT sensors.\"> </a><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\">use of blockchain in Supply Chain</a> and addressed the issue of <strong><em>drug traceability.</em> </strong>In short, we are reducing the possibility to buy a counterfeit drug by tracking the item with the help of IoT sensors and blockchain from the producer&#8217;s factory to our door. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the above mentioned problems, blockchain can also help the healthcare with payments and help to speed the verification of patient&#8217;s healthcare plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;<strong>Blockchain will become the next big healthcare technology innovation,</strong> particularly as it relates to payments and payer contracts. For example, in a situation when a health plan and patient are dealing with a contract, the blockchain can automatically verify and authorize information and the contractual processes. <strong>With transparency and automation, greater efficiencies will lead to lower administration costs, faster claims and less money wasted.&#8221; </strong></p><cite> <br>Bruce Broussard, president and CEO of Humana <br></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the payment process is automated in a <strong><em>trusted, transparent and verifiable</em></strong> way we will notice improvement of the whole process by reducing claim times and lowering administration costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having all information on a single platform is going to allow for deep analysis of population health and trends. Thus helping all parties to make more accurate planning and strategies, allowing them to deliver better, faster and more cost efficient services to the patients. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the next article about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hack.bg/category/blog/blockchain-and-business/\">Blockchain and Business</a>&nbsp;directly in your inbox subscribe to our newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great ideaâââbut you donât have the skill to build it â get in touch with us at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the full list of our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>We bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain&#8217;s Best Use Cases What is blockchain?

We do business with companies and people who we don&#8217;t know.  We have to rely on 3rd party auditors and assessors to make sure that the products, materials or ingredients we are buying are really what they are supposed to be. This is a very expensive process which is done normally in a non-digitalised way.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the other hand, small companies are having a hard time to get into the market due to the lack of trust.  <br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the above-mentioned problems( global scale, trust, and transparency), we are able to identify other key problems like <strong><em>ineffective </em></strong><em><strong>risk management, lack of end-to-end visibility and obsolescence of technologies</strong></em>. All impacting negatively companies ROI. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Risk management</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the supply chain management tool is not having access to key data from the value chain the companies fail to make accurate risk predictions that lead to higher risk exposures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Lack of end-to-end visibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>End-to-end visibility is key to ROI (return on investment). The inadequate supply chain visibility is leading to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Increased inventory costs resulting from inventory build-ups</li><li>Increased freight costs from premium shipping </li><li>Decreased productivity resulting from manually intensive processes</li><li>Poor customer experience</li><li>Loss of revenue from product shortages</li><li>Delayed cash flow</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Obsolescence of technologies</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using old, inefficient and closed (centralized) technologies is damaging companies <em><strong>ROI</strong></em>, partners <em><strong>trust </strong></em>and customers <em><strong>satisfaction</strong></em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that there is a solution to all those problems and it is called blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> Blockchain has the potential to become the universal supply chain operating system â increasing security, improving transparency and creating scalability. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why is blockchain perfect solution to tackle the existing problems of the Supply Chain?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In another series, we have already discussed <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\">what is blockchain</a> and how you can use the technology behind Bitcoin and Ethereum to help your business grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, blockchain is a digital ledger technology used to record transactions in chronological order. One can only add new transactions (not remove or edit), thus the ledger is immutable. Its underlying technology is offering us<em><strong> trust, transparency, and traceability</strong></em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we are going to look into its direct implementation in Supply Chain and learn why it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> <em>Todayâs supply chains are inherently complex- many lacking transparency due to lack of interoperability and inconsistent or unavailable data â areas where blockchain can counter these inefficiencies and add new value.</em><br></p><cite> <br><a href=\"https://www.blockchain-supplychain.com/\">https://www.blockchain-supplychain.com/</a> </cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The supply chain holds tremendous interest in the blockchain. The technology will be most useful in areas such as <em><strong>supplier payments, product traceability, and contract bids and execution</strong></em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us look at them one by one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Supplier Payments</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The area where blockchain is mostly used as of today is the area of <strong>secure, fast and transparent</strong> transactions. Compared to traditional bank wire transfer the <em>cost </em>and <i>speed</i> of blockchain transaction are hundred if not thousandfold faster and cheaper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why blockchain transactions are a perfect way to pay your suppliers.  Even on the other side of the world, they will get their money just in a few seconds (depending on the currency ). <em><strong>Fast</strong></em> settlements are crucial for suppliers giving them more access to capital, thus more opportunities to do business. If you are not the supplier but the business owner instead, you can benefit by saving from the <em><strong>cost</strong></em> of the transactions. That could be a real deal when dealing with large amounts of money.  In addition to fast and cheap, transactions are can be used to for company&#8217;s accounting and auditing. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p> Blockchain can fundamentally transform businesses by eliminating inefficiencies, speeding up transactions and enabling innovative new business models,â said IBM Research China director Dr. Xiaowei Shen.&nbsp;  </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Product Traceability</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another key feature of the blockchain is the ability to track the products from the manufacturer/producer site to the point of sale, thus allowing the customer to check product origin and related details before buying it. This is an invaluable feature allowing each part of the value chain to track the product from raw material provider to the customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain&#8217;s ability to enable end-to-end visibility in Supply Chain can help companies grow their ROI. According to <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3790363\">Gartner Research</a>, the quantitative benefits of implementing end-to-end visibility are phenomenal:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>20% in inventory savings </li><li>25% of increased regional forecast accuracy</li><li>98% of improved service level agreements</li><li>10% reduction of workforce</li><li>30% decrease in inventory stock </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take the car industry as an example to picture the complexity of the value chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-1024x640.png\" alt=\"Supply Chain value chain in car manufacturing industry\" class=\"wp-image-1140\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-1024x640.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-300x188.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-768x480.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars-922x576.png 922w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/supply_chain_cars.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Supply Chain value chain in car manufacturing industry</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Another use case to showcase the importance of <em>traceability </em>is the food/pharma industry where both <strong>producer </strong>and <strong>customer </strong>need to make sure that the product is not a counterfeit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Producers can protect their image and market by making sure that no counterfeit products have been infiltrated into their supply chain. Low-quality counterfeit products will not only reduce the company&#8217;s market share but can also lead to brand detriment when customers buy fake products with inferior quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For customers, quality can also mean health risks when we speak about alimentary products and pharma.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Implications of food safety and pharma</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>With growing global supply chains, food safety is a top concern with both consumers and regulators. The <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2015/foodborne-disease-estimates/en/\" target=\"_blank\">World Health Organization</a>&nbsp;(WHO) estimates that 420,000 people die annually from food contamination, which affects one in 10 people worldwide. Children under age five are at the highest risk with 125,000 children dying every year from foodborne illness, according to WHO. </p><cite><br></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The World Health Organization pegged global fake drug sales at $75bn in 2010, a 90% increase over five years. The issue of counterfeit medicines has become increasingly pressing, both in terms of the economic cost of this global black market and the risk to human life that comes from taking counterfeit drugs that may not have the same active pharmaceutical ingredients or dosage levels.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain can eliminate those risks by allowing end users to track each item origin with the help of IoT sensors. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3> Helping the small </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond product integrity and anti-counterfeiting efforts, blockchain could also play a role in overcoming the financial challenges faced by smaller operators along the supply chain.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In China, for example, pharma retailers â which often have to wait two to three months to receive payment for delivered medicines â have experienced problems accessing financing without proper credit records and collateral, which the transparency of blockchain could provide. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Contract bid and execution</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the process of buying is automated via <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contract</a> all parties can verify it. The smart contract enables trustless trade between absolute strangers, with the capability to introduce rules for trades that are at all stages transparent and self-enforcing. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Data and Governance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, besides bringing more trust the blockchain systems are also a good source of data collection because of their transparency. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, their immutable nature is guaranteeing better data quality. Thus, allowing companies to better manage their supply chain and to optimize their processes. This in return is helping them stay ahead of the competition, win bigger market share and make more profits. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the next article about <a href=\"https://hack.bg/category/blog/blockchain-and-business/\">Blockchain and Business</a> directly in your inbox subscribe to our newsletter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a great ideaâââbut you donât have the skill to build it â get in touch with us at&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\" target=\"_blank\">hello@hack.bg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the full list of our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>We bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchainâs Best Use Case Series Inspired by a recent event, the Dronathon that we have co-organized with Premium CoWorking Space in Sofia we decided to shed some light on the role of blockchain in Supply Chain.
