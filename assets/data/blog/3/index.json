His presentation started with a short evolution of money, from the exchange of goods, through the gold standard and paper money to the digital currencies. It is important to realize the chain of events that led us to the fiat currencies and the dependencies that we have created around money and on money printing organizations like FED, to realize the benefits of Decentralized Finance. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"762\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-1024x762.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1607\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-1024x762.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-300x223.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-768x571.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-774x576.jpg 774w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Tito Tiov &#8211; WeiDex</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into the details, Tito gave his best to explain to us what Decentralized Finance is, what are the use cases and what can we do on top of &#8220;Money Legos&#8221; as he called the existing DeFi platforms.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at them one by one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to the existing monetary system, where the money is printed by a government organization and the printed money is not backed by anything, since the removal of the gold standard, DeFi is based on digital assest and smart contracts build on top of blockchain protocols allowing fully transparent governance and creation of &#8220;money&#8221;, p2p lending and trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his presentation, Tito introduced us to some of the most advanced protocols build to power the growing market of DeFi dApps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, he spoke about the biggest and most famous app <a href=\"https://makerdao.com/en/\">Maker Dao</a>. Brading itself as &#8220;Transparent and sustainable finance&#8221;. Maker is comprised of a decentralized stablecoin, collateral loans, and community governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second to Maker by the number of users and revenue was Compound.  <a href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Compound </a>is an open-source, autonomous protocol built for developers, to unlock a universe of new financial applications. Interest and borrowing, for the open financial system.  Their protocol is allowing many to build new and exiting application on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Tito spoke about  <a href=\"https://www.synthetix.io/\">Synthetix</a>, running  Synths, tokens that provide exposure to assets such as gold, Bitcoin, U.S. Dollars, stocks like TESLA, and AAPL within the Ethereum blockchain. And<a href=\"https://instadapp.io/\"> Insta dApp</a>,  Autonomous Banking Portal on Emerging Blockchain-based Financial Protocols.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the above-mentioned protocols and dApps could be used as building blocks of your future DeFi dApp, instantly and without need to pay additional fees.  One can easily start a new business only by building a fancier UI on top of Compound&#8217;s protocol as Tito mentioned in one of his examples of successful ways to use the existing infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"552\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1024x552.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1608\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1024x552.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-300x162.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-768x414.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1038x559.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image.png 1227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>money legos in practice</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As a CEO of WeiDex, Tito shared with us his company experience of using &#8220;money legos&#8221; in practice to boost the liquidity on their multi-chain decentralized exchange. Providing their users with excellent trading experience without the need to spend extra money on market makers and liquidity providers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly before the end, Tito walked us through a few smart contacts, showing us how we can build on top of the existing dApps or add them to our products to boost our revenues and to make the user experience richer and nicer.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, we can say that the meetup was been equally interesting and important for developers, entrepreneurs, and investors giving to each group enough information to spark their interest in Decentralized Finance witch is considered to be the next killer application of blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> What is your opinion on Defi?

The novelty is the way the consensus is done.  The nodes are randomly asking other nodes about their opinion, and building up their own confidence in their opinion vs other&#8217;s opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Statebox is building a formally verified process language using robust mathematical principles to prevent errors, allow compositionality and ensure termination. In addition, the language is visual and allows one to inspect the flow of the program as it is executing. These properties make Statebox suitable for distributed systems, blockchains, workflow management systems, application orchestration, and system architecture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Ethereum dev space we have seen:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Synthetix released a new category of Synths this week &#8211; Index Tokens.

But is Bitcoin really suitable for accepting payments? What is the best way to do it? What are the challenges? Those are a few of the questions that Rali was answering during his presentation. For those of you who missed we are going to answer them one by one here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into more details, Rali sent some chills in the public by sharing his view that Bitcoin is just a Hipster&#8217;s tool for payments :). Some of the arguments where that currently Bitcoin has been mostly used for speculation and rarely to buy stuff. One of the reasons might be that most retailers are having bad rates when accepting Bitcoin. For example, a product purchased in BTC could cost 20% higher if purchased in USD. Another cornerstone of the problem could be the transaction time. Rali also claimed that there are probably more pictures of the famous &#8220;Accepting Bitcoin&#8221; sticker circulating on the Internet than actual transactions on the bitcoin network. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202129-e1567177470863-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1574\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202129-e1567177470863-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202129-e1567177470863-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202129-e1567177470863-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>blockchain developers meetup</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what has been said, Bitcoin is still used by some retailers to accept payments. Rali&#8217;s work experience led him to implement solutions in a different way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first solution would be to use a third party service. According to Rali it is relatively easy to integrate a solution that is providing an easy way to convert BTC to your local currency. The convenience is that you don&#8217;t have to care about confirmation time and you don&#8217;t have to manage a wallet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawbacks are the high fees, the lack of control over your funds and the fact that you can be tracked. Additionally, if you are a service requiring multiple simultaneous transactions, you can easily hit the Gap limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This solution could be ideal for small businesses with low transaction volume and low technical teams willing to accept Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second solution discussed by Rali was the use of pre-generated addresses. The advantage is the user is keeping control over his public and private keys. However the use of many addresses can slow down the wallet&#8217;s operations. According to our speaker, this solution is ideal for fast prototyping and for exchanges.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202143-e1567177584386-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1575\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202143-e1567177584386-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202143-e1567177584386-300x225.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/IMG_20190829_202143-e1567177584386-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>blockchain dev meetup Q|A</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The third and last option will be to generate addresses on-demand, notably the most recommended and scalable solution to use if you are tech-savvy.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To conclude his talk Rali have to the public his recommendation on wallets and resources, mentioning about Bitcoin core wallet, Electrum daemon and Mastering Bitcoin, the book of Andreas Antonopoulos.

These protocols provide a strong probabilistic safety guarantee in the presence of Byzantine adversaries while their concurrent and leaderless nature enables them to achieve high throughput and scalability.  Unlike blockchains that rely on proof-of-work, they are quiescent and green. Unlike traditional consensus protocols where one or more nodes typically process linear bits in the number of total nodes per decision, no node processes more than logarithmic bits.  It does not require accurate knowledge of all participants and exposes new possible tradeoffs and improvements in safety and liveness for building consensus protocols. The paper describes the Snow protocol family, analyzes its guarantees, and describes how it can be used to construct the core of an internet-scale electronic payment system called Avalanche, which is evaluated in a large scale deployment.  Experiments demonstrate that the system can achieve high throughput  (3400tps), provide low confirmation latency (1.35  sec),  and scale well compared to existing systems that deliver similar functionality. For our implementation and setup, the bottleneck of the system is in transaction verification.</p><cite>https://avalabs.org/QmT1ry38PAmnhparPUmsUNHDEGHQusBLD6T5XJh4mUUn3v.pdf</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s even a really nice graphical demo here: <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://avalabs.org/snow-bft-demo/#/snow\" target=\"_blank\">https://avalabs.org/snow-bft-demo/#/snow</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DappCon</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>DappCon focuses on decentralized applications, tooling, and foundational infrastructure on Ethereum. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This event is bringing together hundreds of blockchain and smart contracts developers, researchers and enthusiasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This years edition was a great place for anyone in interested in the ecosystem or networking with dapp developers to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>ETHBerlin hackathon</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We assume if you’re reading this document, that you know what ETHBerlin Zwei is, but to recap: ETHBerlin Zwei is a combination of a hackathon, experiences, workshops and talks, happening from 21st till 25th of August 2019 in Berlin, Germany.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Although we did not participated hacking at the ETHBerlin hackathon, there were quite big amount of other clever people there, which didn&#8217;t stayed unnoticed (our friends from AirGap got to win one of the prizes). </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aeternity Meetup</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the peak of the 10+days long event &#8211; Blockchain Week Berlin aeternity invited developers to join and meet at the Blockchain Embassy and talk blockchain, with beers and pizzas!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-1024x768.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1545\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-1024x768.jpeg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/photo_2019-08-29-08.46.17.jpeg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Philipp Piwowarsky &amp; Milen Radkov presenting at Aeternity Meetup Berlin</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Philipp and Milen did an Introduction to <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/tutorials/build-your-first-decentralized-application-aepp-on-aeternity-blockchain-sophia-smart-contract-address-book/\">Sophia Smart Contracts</a> on æternity.

If you are a novice to the concept of blockchain or you are still struggling to get into its core <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-to-boost-your-business-with-blockchain/\">you can read about</a> in our previous articles where we speak about the technology in details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put it short, blockchain is all about <em><strong>trust, transparency, </strong></em>and <em><strong>traceability.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes blockchain so popular is the ability to be implemented in any kind of business having transactions (monetary or not), immutable record-keeping or programmable agreement (<a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contract</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p> In our previous posts, we have outlined specific business cases where we can apply the technology. Most in-demand arias are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\">Finance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\">Supply Chain</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-healthcare/\">Healthcare</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-gaming/\">Gaming</a></li><li><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-insurance/\">Insurance</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At this stage, we can stay that we are still developing the infrastructure to onboard more and more sectors and businesses. It is safe to assume that blockchain applications will be driving the world in the next 10-15 years, helping companies to <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\">reduce costs and increase efficiency</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Real Estate Market</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we are going to discuss the difficulties faced by the global real estate market and the potential of blockchain to help the market grow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Global real estate worth all sectors combined represents the whopping <em><strong>$217 trillion</strong></em>.&nbsp;Mostly dominated by the wealthy and large corporations. Through&nbsp;the blockchain, more people will be able to access the market where transactions can now be made more transparent, secure, and equitable.&nbsp; </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"729\" height=\"243\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1524\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image.png 729w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-300x100.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2> Real Estate Problems / Solutions</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Platforms and Marketplaces</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the property listing is done on multiple platforms, resulting in time-consuming and costly operations when one is in a search for the ideal industrial or private property. There are also issues with data accuracy because the listings are done depending on broker preferences. This lack of standardization is further complicating the search process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Decentralized</em></strong> property record will enable fast and efficient property discovery.  A blockchain-based system would enable data to be distributed across a peer-to-peer network in a manner that allows brokers to have more control over their data, along with increased trust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Title records</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Title records are another challenging-to-access  aspect of the real estate buying/selling process. Even at the age of the Internet, title  information remains stored at the local level and is offline. Blockchain can offer a new and more efficient way to to deal with this problem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Blockchain</em></strong> could provide a central title database to securely store and instantly access historical title records, allowing for the streamlining of title transfer in a property sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Financial transaction</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying, selling or renting a property has a cost. There are professional fees and commissions, inspections costs, registration fees, loan fees, and taxes associated with real estate. These costs even vary depending on the jurisdiction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Payments and transaction done via banks and other intermediaries are slow and expensive. Especially when we are dealing with cross-border transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Commercial Real Estate cash flow management</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In commercial real estate, there are various actors involved in the renting/buying/ selling process. Vendors, landlords, tenants, and property managers all performing multiple transactions checks and verifications resulting in more complicated accounting. This is making the process not only slower but also costlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"744\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1527\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3.png 744w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3-300x249.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-3-693x576.png 693w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">Smart contracts</a> enable easier, transparent, and efficient property management and cash flow management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Executing a real estate lease using<strong><em> smart contracts</em></strong> can address many of the challenges associated with property and cash flow management. The traditional lease contract can morph into a smart tenancy contract.The contract could use rent or bonds for automated payments to real estate owners, property managers, and other stakeholders along with near real-time reconciliation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blockchain transactions </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"747\" height=\"435\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1525\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1.png 747w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-1-300x175.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is allowing for fast, secure and cheap cross-border transactions.

Besides facilitating transactions, blockchain can allow for real estate to become more liquid. Property tokenization might be the next big thing for the sector allowing fractional ownership. A seller doesn’t have to wait for a buyer who can afford the whole property in order to get some value out of their property. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally blockchain also lowers the barriers to real estate investing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Blockchain technology can improve the real estate ecosystem by enabling  all involved parties to securely and efficiently share data and money. It  makes information more accessible, cuts out middlemen and reduces the  risk of fraud and theft.

They are increasingly open to forming partnerships with InsurTechs and using technology. </em></p><cite><a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/insurance/library/top-issues.html\">PwC</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The most promising solutions that have been explored to make the insurance companies more cost-effective, thus more profitable, are Cloud computing and Blockchain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While cloud computing has started to affirm its importance in the space, we are yet to witness how blockchain is going to transform the insurance industry. One thing that we can notice is the exploration of how companies can collaborate with competitors. This results in the creation of consortiums expected to launch blockchain initiatives that are going to impact the space in the near future. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are the current problems?</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Intermediaries</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The insurance industry is built around intermediaries (agents and brokers) and companies are heavily relying on their performance to satisfy customer&#8217;s growing expectations.  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>When customers interact with an insurer, their benchmark isn’t one carrier versus another, it’s their experience with online retailers and service providers (e.g., video streaming). This has resulted in customers expecting a much faster, transparent, and more intuitive experience than they’ve ever had before. </em></p><cite><a href=\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/insurance/assets/pwc-2019-insurance-issues-compilation-report.pdf\">PwC</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h4>Paperwork </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another noticeable problem is that there’s still too much manual work, inefficiencies in distribution, and inconsistent levels of customer service that are punishing both customers and companies. Customers are suffering because of the quality of the service that they get and the companies because of the missed opportunities and profits.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Data quality  </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance companies are relying heavily on data. Third-party data is often inaccurate and expensive. Companies are spending time to analyze it and integrate it into their business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digitizing the business will allow companies to generate their own data, thus know and serve their customers better. In this regard, with future development of blockchain and when people start having digital identities, it will be easier to identify a user&#8217;s profile (understand his needs), without revealing his identity to the provider. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are the solutions?</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Blockchain can cut the intermediaries</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain digital nature is allowing insurance companies to create digital products, that the users can subscribe to online, without a need of an intermediary. The current heavy re-alliance on intermediaries does not only increase the cost of operation but can also lead to poor customer experience, witch than can affect the brand and hurt the revenues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second-generation blockchain networks allowing us to <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">create smart contracts</a> are the perfect fit for organizations willing to create <strong><em>transparent </em></strong>and <strong><em>automated </em></strong>solutions to serve the needs of their online customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"539\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2-1024x539.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1460\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2-1024x539.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2-300x158.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2-768x404.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2-1038x547.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-2.png 1088w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption><a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">Smart Contract Life Cycle</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>Reduce the paperwork</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another benefit of using digital products is the reduced amount of needed paperwork.  Everything in a blockchain is handled electronically and in near real-time, so time spent on paperwork is decreased, thus saving man-hours to handle the manual paperwork processes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Improve the quality of the data</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Data is the new gold. Companies are trying to understand more about their customer&#8217;s behaviour and need to be able to propose tailor-made solutions but also to analyse and comprehend the industry&#8217;s trends and competitor&#8217;s market presence. Blockchain&#8217;s transparency and immutable nature are perfect features enabling insurance companies to record, store and analyse the data, that is coming from the interaction of the customers with their products. One can also trust this data because we know that it is real, not manipulated data. This, in turn, can help companies make better predictions and design better risk models, allowing them to minimize risk and maximize their profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Reduce Transactions time and cost </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides the above-mentioned solutions that can help insurance companies improve their profits and processes, companies can use blockchain to pay customer claims.  The process can be near-instant, with a heavy reduction of cost per transaction. This will not only help cut transaction fees but also will improve the company relationship with its customers. Speeding up the repayment process can lead to increased trust and customer satisfaction.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the financial sector, the general view in the industry towards the adoption of blockchain technology is &#8220;wait and see&#8221;. The reason could be that companies are feeling satisfied with the recent years achievements as their market and profits grew in size. However, it is worth mentioning that, blockchain early adoption can lead companies to a competitive advantage over their competitors allowing them to stay in the front-line of the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not being a panacea,  we believe that blockchain technology can offer a significant improvement on processes like transaction handling, improvement of data quality, paperwork reduction and reduction of intermediaries giving early adopters clear advantage over their competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need more information, get in touch with us at <a href=\"mailto:hello@hack.bg\">hello@hack.bg</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team is here to help you from architecture design to a perfectly working solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at the full list of our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://hack.bg/#services\" target=\"_blank\">services</a>&nbsp;on our website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>We bring ideas to life.</em></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>We have discussed widely in our previous articles the fundamentals of Blockchain.
