His presentation started with a short evolution of money, from the exchange of goods, through the gold standard and paper money to the digital currencies. It is important to realize the chain of events that led us to the fiat currencies and the dependencies that we have created around money and on money printing organizations like FED, to realize the benefits of Decentralized Finance. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"762\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-1024x762.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1607\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-1024x762.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-300x223.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-768x571.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n-774x576.jpg 774w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/71498414_379925339620081_4764385845400567808_n.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Tito Tiov &#8211; WeiDex</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into the details, Tito gave his best to explain to us what Decentralized Finance is, what are the use cases and what can we do on top of &#8220;Money Legos&#8221; as he called the existing DeFi platforms.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at them one by one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to the existing monetary system, where the money is printed by a government organization and the printed money is not backed by anything, since the removal of the gold standard, DeFi is based on digital assest and smart contracts build on top of blockchain protocols allowing fully transparent governance and creation of &#8220;money&#8221;, p2p lending and trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his presentation, Tito introduced us to some of the most advanced protocols build to power the growing market of DeFi dApps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, he spoke about the biggest and most famous app <a href=\"https://makerdao.com/en/\">Maker Dao</a>. Brading itself as &#8220;Transparent and sustainable finance&#8221;. Maker is comprised of a decentralized stablecoin, collateral loans, and community governance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second to Maker by the number of users and revenue was Compound.  <a href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Compound </a>is an open-source, autonomous protocol built for developers, to unlock a universe of new financial applications. Interest and borrowing, for the open financial system.  Their protocol is allowing many to build new and exiting application on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Tito spoke about  <a href=\"https://www.synthetix.io/\">Synthetix</a>, running  Synths, tokens that provide exposure to assets such as gold, Bitcoin, U.S. Dollars, stocks like TESLA, and AAPL within the Ethereum blockchain. And<a href=\"https://instadapp.io/\"> Insta dApp</a>,  Autonomous Banking Portal on Emerging Blockchain-based Financial Protocols.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the above-mentioned protocols and dApps could be used as building blocks of your future DeFi dApp, instantly and without need to pay additional fees.  One can easily start a new business only by building a fancier UI on top of Compound&#8217;s protocol as Tito mentioned in one of his examples of successful ways to use the existing infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"552\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1024x552.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1608\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1024x552.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-300x162.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-768x414.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1038x559.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image.png 1227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>money legos in practice</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As a CEO of WeiDex, Tito shared with us his company experience of using &#8220;money legos&#8221; in practice to boost the liquidity on their multi-chain decentralized exchange. Providing their users with excellent trading experience without the need to spend extra money on market makers and liquidity providers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly before the end, Tito walked us through a few smart contacts, showing us how we can build on top of the existing dApps or add them to our products to boost our revenues and to make the user experience richer and nicer.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, we can say that the meetup was been equally interesting and important for developers, entrepreneurs, and investors giving to each group enough information to spark their interest in Decentralized Finance witch is considered to be the next killer application of blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> What is your opinion on Defi?
