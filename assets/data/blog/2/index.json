To achieve that DeFi relies heavily on cryptography, <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/blockchain-software-development/\">blockchain</a>, and <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/smart-contracts-vs-traditional-contracts/\">smart contracts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts are the main building blocks of DeFi. If you don&#8217;t know what smart contracts are, you can check one of the previous <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-are-smart-contracts-and-blockchain-adding-value-to-my-business/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">articles where this is discussed.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DeFi Projects. What is trendy?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It is currently known that most if not all DeFi projects are built on <a href=\"https://ethereum.org/en/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Ethereum</a>. The main reason for this is that Ethereum’s programing language called Solidity allows writing advanced smart contacts that contain the most necessary logic for the DeFi applications. It is worth commemorating that Ethereum has the most advanced ecosystem across all the smart contract developers, in fact, all the applications mentioned here are built on Ethereum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article we are going to look at the different categories where DeFi is used:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Lending and borrowing&nbsp;</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In this category, there is one main project that by this date is so far the biggest DeFi project &#8211; <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://compound.finance/\">Compound</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has around 1.8 billion dollars worth of assets locked in the protocol. Compound is an algorithmic and autonomous protocol that allows users to supply assets such as Ether, DAI, Basic Attention Token(BAT), 0x, Tether, and start making interest. It also has the option to borrow other assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"401\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-1024x401.png\" alt=\"Compound finance market\" class=\"wp-image-2409\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-1024x401.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-300x117.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-768x301.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-1536x601.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09-1038x406.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot-2020-10-08-at-18.40.09.png 1742w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>https://compound.finance/markets date: 07.10.2020</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://makerdao.com/en/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">MakerDAO</a> is another project in the same category that allows users to use ETH to lend themselves money in the form of a stable coin called DAI and when users are ready to unlock their ETH, which serves as collateral for their DAI loan, they simply pay back the loan along with any fees. By combining loans with a stable currency, MakerDAO wants to allow anyone to borrow money and reliably predict how much they have to pay back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Stable coins</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With the help of smart contracts and certain incentives a stable coin can be created pegged to the US dollar without having to store money in the real world. As we mentioned MakerDAO that locks in collateral and generates DAI. DAi is a good example of an algorithmic stable coin. Except for DAI, there are other non-algorithmic stable coins such as Tether and USD coin. The problem with them is the fact that they are centralized because there is a company that stands behind them which is responsible for holding the equivalent of the stable coins in US dollars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2398\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bermix-studio-aX1hN4uNd-I-unsplash-min-864x576.jpg 864w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@bermixstudio?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Bermix Studio</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/coin?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h4>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>DEXs enables the exchange of crypto assets in a completely decentralized and permissionless way, without giving up the custody of the coins. In other words, your coins or tokens do not need to be held by a third party exchange while you trade. Decentralized exchanges can also prevent price manipulation and are more anonymous than exchanges that implement know-your-customer requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two main types of DEXs:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Liquidity Pool based is the first one. Examples for this type are &#8211; <a href=\"https://uniswap.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">UniSwap</a>, <a href=\"https://kyber.network/about/knc?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=8c58ddde734d1eb7030750ac46cf98eff58a2d6c-1602130160-0-Afgf-lIRnkrH7lOEGcF0_DHeWExaE1cuwbzCnV_J5fKVxIJNCvt3Mp8K-gDN85h8zWis_hPzNuEo0U9eVEuTgdgfaJm6qQ-cxCSH9R89CUd8jt12Y_dfImGXt_krupK3-7N7zl_odVU57vWY3mA_MtYf67QkqH-NP1gflm3CEbDV9dEBFsDQ7kdktUHoheJ1YaO1GG_w3qWtSvNLQ5XrxcFB9GZyKieQHAKASdPUu-N19y4o_k_p4um7VOK9GSSszdvkllXHiFuSOIIaaY8PZSoAStgpfjGzIZKbEOZquUXyPUteTC2eQ9KRCXjZDh0jInfHjRJpCcDkqeNBTH6rvMwSEaMyy18Sn-_n4jLF-KzJ\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Kyber network</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bancor.network/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Bankor</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Order Book based is the second type. <a href=\"https://loopring.org/#/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Loopring</a>, <a href=\"https://idex.market/eth/idex\" class=\"rank-math-link\">IDEX</a>, and <a href=\"http://weidex.market\" class=\"rank-math-link\">WeiDex</a> are examples of an order booked based decentralized exchange.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>Margin Trading</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Margin trading similar to traditional finance is the practice of using borrowed funds to increase a position in certain assets. In contrast with regular trading in which traders use their own capital to fund trades, margin trading allows traders to multiply the amount of capital they are able to trade. This is why margin trading is also often referred to as leverage trading — “leverage” is the amount by which a trader is able to multiply their position. The main DeFi application in the margin trading space is <a href=\"https://fulcrum.trade/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Fulcrum</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Insurance</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Insurance is another field of traditional finance that can be transformed into decentralized finance. Blockchain technology can contribute in many different ways enabling real-time data collection and analysis, which could make significantly speed up claims processing and payouts; ensuring that transactions are secure, authenticated, and verifiable, protecting customer&#8217;s privacy. It can provide certain kinds of guarantees of compensation in exchange for payment of premiums. One of the most popular applications are oriented with complications related to protection against smart contract failures and the protection of deposits. The most well-known insurance projects are <a href=\"https://nexusmutual.io/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Nexus Mutual </a>and <a href=\"https://opyn.co/#/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Opyn</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While more and more people are being drawn to these DeFi applications, it’s hard to say where they’ll go. Much of that depends on who finds them useful and why. Many believe various DeFi projects have the potential to become the next Robinhood, drawing in hordes of new users by making financial applications more inclusive and open to those who don’t traditionally have access to such platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay tuned for our next article piece about the Blockchain world &amp; Subscribe to our newsletter.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>What is DeFi?

They have the capability to receive, store, and send funds and even call other smart contracts by following if-then semantics. Some even may have heard of the expression “Code is law”- which means that technology is used to enforce rules. Basically the code dictates what we can and cannot do.<br>The smart contract’s aim is to remove the human factor from the decision making which is often proven to be the main cause of errors. A smart contract is usually written on the programming language called <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.1/\">Solidity</a>, which was created specifically for that purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ethereum.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Ethereum</a> is a good example of a blockchain that supports smart contracts. On the chart below we see the daily verification of contracts on Ethereum from the year 2016 to the year 2019 which shows us that there are a growing interest and usage of smart contracts. And there should be. Аlthough blockchain is a relatively young technology, it has certainly shown us through smart contracts many use cases why today’s world should shift towards decentralized interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"939\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chart-1024x939.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2366\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chart-1024x939.jpeg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chart-300x275.jpeg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chart-768x704.jpeg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chart-628x576.jpeg 628w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/chart.jpeg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Source: etherscan.io</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br>In previous article, we looked at <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/how-are-smart-contracts-and-blockchain-adding-value-to-my-business/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">how Smart contacts are adding value to the business</a>. This time we shall see the benefits of the smart contracts by comparing them to the equivalent in real life &#8211; the traditional contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say you want to send tokens to someone, and that someone wants to send the same amount of other tokens. With a traditional contract, if you don&#8217;t trust the person, an escrow contract should be created, where a third party participates. The middle man would collect the token from both sides and then swap them. This approach already shows some problems that both parties of the contact may be facing:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"630\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RM7.8.19_ff_contractrisks.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2368\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RM7.8.19_ff_contractrisks.jpg 630w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/RM7.8.19_ff_contractrisks-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" /><figcaption>Source: http://www.rmmagazine.com</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trusting Intermediaries:<br></strong>There is no guarantee that the third party will not run away with the tokens. Both sides should rely entirely on the reputation of the intermediary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>On the other hand, a smart contract will work in a fully automated and deterministic way, which means the same output will be generated from a given initial state/input, making sure that both parties receive their tokens when meeting the criteria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Speed:</strong><br>Depending on the intermediary, both parties may have to wait up to working time to settle the transaction of the tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With smart contacts, this kind of problem goes away. A contract can be fulfilled seconds after the initial criteria are met.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cost:<br></strong>A traditional contract is considered much more expensive than a smart contract, not just because of the third party that has to make a profit but also because there are so-called “hidden expenses” considering possible problems with the contract like arbitration for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"802\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/neonbrand-8fDhgAN5zG0-unsplash-1024x802.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2367\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/neonbrand-8fDhgAN5zG0-unsplash-1024x802.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/neonbrand-8fDhgAN5zG0-unsplash-300x235.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/neonbrand-8fDhgAN5zG0-unsplash-768x601.jpg 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/neonbrand-8fDhgAN5zG0-unsplash-1536x1202.jpg 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/neonbrand-8fDhgAN5zG0-unsplash-736x576.jpg 736w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@neonbrand?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">NeONBRAND</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/cost?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The blockchain protocol seems to eliminate the costs of external enforcement and, therefore, smart contracts are sold as self-executed and able to solve the problem of opportunism which characterizes traditional contracts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reusability:</strong><br>The same smart contract that is used to swap your tokens, can be used to swap anyone else tokens.<br>In the traditional world, separate contracts should be made and respective fees to the intermediary should be paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fraud:</strong><br>The intermediary should make sure that both the tokens that you and the other side have are legitimate before making a swap.<br>With smart contracts, the tokens can be verified on the blockchain, and with digital signatures, it can be certain straight away if the parties are eligible for spending their tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>The difference between the two types of contracts shows us that a new era of agreement is coming. Smart contracts are still considered a novelty and many questions remain unanswered among &#8211; How will the government decide to regulate such contracts?; How will they be taxed?; What happens if the contract can’t get access to the subject of the agreement?<br>But seeing how the technology evolves it seems a matter only of time things to be perfected. Smart contracts are for surely turning the hype into reality and will become a part of our everyday life.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>What is a smart contract?

In other words, this is a shared database where one can register <em><strong>ownership rights</strong></em>, <em><strong>licensing terms, and royalty rules</strong></em>, globally accessible and potentially validated by all parties depending on the type of consensus mechanisms in place. This could provide tamper-resistant evidence of ownership for the cataloging and store of original works, which would present great benefits in providing clarity to copyright authors, owners, and users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This means third parties would be able to use the blockchain to see the complete chain of ownership of a piece of work.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Records on the Blockchain can be used as a digital certificate of authenticity that will help third parties to identify authors of works. This tamper-resistant register of all sales, licenses,  and transfers of original works would help authors or artists to track when and who is using their work and to get more just royalty fees for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Transforming industry, trade and markets</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"943\" height=\"639\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1690\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1.png 943w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1-300x203.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1-768x520.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-1-850x576.png 850w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 943px) 100vw, 943px\" /><figcaption>digital media distribution</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to protecting the rights of the original creators of digital work, who may retain some rights after selling their content, blockchain technology could also protect consumer rights associated with digital products. This could apply to both mass-reproduced works equivalent to CDs and books as well as to the emerging field of unique digital artworks, which can be considered the digital equivalent of paintings. Consumers or buyers could also more easily verify the real owner of the content, the type of version, the set of rights attached to it, and agree to the terms set by the rights holders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizations and entities involved in the music and media business, like record labels, publishers, performing rights societies, streaming services,<br> managers, artists, and start-ups could benefit from such a record to counter lost or misdirected rights revenues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain could be the technological basis to build a single online copyright and information portals for musical works where creators/artists will be able to automatically license and sell their work using smart contracts and associated cryptocurrencies. For example, a piece of music is inserted and published publicly in the ledger as belonging to the artist, and including licensing terms to enable consumers or buyers to compensate the artist according to the terms set out in smart contracts.  In the future, it could be possible for artists and consumers to have portable digital identities running on a blockchain but interoperable with streaming services like SoundCloud, YouTube, and other online music services.<br> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open ecosystems could reduce the entry barriers for new artists, simplify licensing and rights management, facilitate immediate payments to owners and creators, and enable new applications, products, and services with minimal friction and more balanced distribution or sharing of the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"298\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x298-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1788\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x298-1.jpg 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x298-1-300x87.jpg 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image-3-1024x298-1-768x224.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Smart Contracts</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The wide deployment of blockchain systems in creative industries could help prevent infringements or unauthorized use, and overall enable more efficient, cost-effective, and potentially fairer ways to compensate the owners and creators through pay-per-usage, micropayments or automatic payment distributions. Smart contracts could be useful in assisting in the sale and licensing. Transforming industry, trade, and markets by specific parties, such as writers, publishers or artists, check the use or streaming of this composition, then automatically execute how the revenue is divided by the copyright owner or owners, and eventually distributing the payments seamlessly.<br> <br>The combination of blockchain technology, IP, and smart contracts could also access content that can be lent to others for fixed periods before automatic return.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the current limitations?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an opportunity for organizations to leverage smart contract technology by integrating smart contract code and blockchain for the purpose of overseeing agreements and licensing. However, smart contract technology has yet to reach a mature stage where it can process a large number of transactions and update and revise contracts across a multiparty network (multi-chain interoperability). </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"779\" height=\"545\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1693\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4.png 779w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-300x210.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/image-4-768x537.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 779px) 100vw, 779px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Other challenges are related to current regulatory constraints and a need for wider recognition of blockchain. Possible regulatory constraints include questions regarding the issues of applicable laws and jurisdiction, the enforceability of smart IP rights (IP rights recorded in distributed ledgers), reliable rules and definitions for smart contracts, data security and privacy concerns. Yet various governmental agencies and IP registers,<br> for example, the European Union Intellectual Property Office is looking into the technology’s capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The general expectation around the use of blockchain is that it could support alternative business models for digital works according to the conditions set by their rights owners (either for free under certain conditions, or at a price), and ultimately change the dynamics between creators, authors, users, and distributors. This would imply defining and experimenting with new incentives to connect such a different set of stakeholders through greater transparency and data sharing.<br> </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, we can say that open and trusted access to data could create knowledge feedback loops between diverse stakeholders and foster groundbreaking data-driven applications running not only on the blockchain but deploying AI, machine learning, data analytics, and so on.  In the long run, multi-stakeholder inclusive innovation ecosystems could be running on a blockchain with no central authority, with multiple providers depending on the function needed, and with full interoperability between different services. This would be a modular approach for an open and transparent meta-system running with individual systems, not only adapted to the specific problems they are designed to solve but also fully interoperable with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would be accomplished by using open standards and accessible data running on blockchain systems, and in compliance with independent certification and/or regulatory frameworks within a multi-stakeholder model.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>In a recent report entitled &#8220;Blockchain Now and Tomorrow&#8221; released by the EU (European Union) Science Hub, the authors are [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"18","title":"Blockchain and Business","path":"/category/blockchain-and-business/"}],"author":{"name":"Hristo","path":"/author/hgeorgiev/"},"featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/pages-3554116_1920.jpg","altText":"Digital content on blockchain"}}},{"node":{"date":"2020-03-29T21:36:50","id":"1667","title":"From zero to a fully-fledged aeternity decentralized application in less than 10 minutes","path":"/blog/from-zero-to-fully-fledged-decentralized-application-in-less-than-10-minutes/","content":"\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"453\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-29-at-21.38.18-2-1024x453.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1775\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-29-at-21.38.18-2-1024x453.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-29-at-21.38.18-2-300x133.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-29-at-21.38.18-2-768x340.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-29-at-21.38.18-2-1038x459.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Intro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s be honest and put the cards down &#8211; if you really need to build a production-ready decentralized application 10 minutes won&#8217;t be nearly enough for sure, and if you are not familiar with the technology you might need some assistance with the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contracts development</a> and setup.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing such a <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/decentralized-applications-development/\">decentralized application</a> will be a combination of planning and structuring the architecture of the project, drafting and designing the user interface (UI), writing, testing and deploying the smart contracts needed for the dapp to run its business logic … and combining all this together. This also involves a wide variety of technology stack options, depending on the desired outcome and use-case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the purpose of this tutorial though, we will develop an app from scratch to a working decentralized application on aeternity blockchain with a simple frontend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now let the timer start:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Initialize our project</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We will use the <a href=\"https://github.com/aeternity/aepp-aeproject-js\">aeproject</a> tool which will allow us to easily set up the development environment locally.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>dependencies<ul><li>docker</li><li>npm &amp; node</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Install globally</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>npm install -g aeproject</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Initialize project</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aeproject init</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Write our smart contract(s)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this step, we will develop a simple smart contract that is only storing an integer (number) in its state on the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s also add a getter method which will allow us to read from the contract state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, we will do something like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>@compiler >= 4\n\ncontract MyContract =\n   record state = { number: int }\n   entrypoint init() : state = { number = 0 }\n   stateful entrypoint set(x: int) = put(state{number = x})\n   stateful entrypoint get() : int = state.number</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In our case, we can further simplify our contract since we are only storing a single integer value. As we know Sophia contracts have restricted mutable state and it is a strongly typed language so we need to define it initially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, we can define our <code>state</code> to be of <code>type</code> <code>int</code> as we don&#8217;t need the whole <code>record</code> structure for this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>@compiler >= 4\n\ncontract MyContract =\n   type state = int\n   entrypoint init() : state = 0\n   stateful entrypoint set(x: int) = put(x)\n   stateful entrypoint get() : int = state</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the same contract, written in Solidity, on Ethereum blockchain just for comparison if you are more familiar with Solidity &#8230; or not:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>pragma solidity >=0.5.0 &lt;0.6.0; \n\ncontract MyContract {\n    uint256 number;\n    constructor() public {\n        number = 0;\n    }\n    function set(uint256 _number) public {\n        number = _number;\n    }\n    function get() public view returns (uint256) {\n        return number;    \n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Deploy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order for us to deploy to an actual <code>testnet</code> or <code>mainnet</code> we need to have some AE tokens on the selected network, so we can pay the mining fee for the transactions we will make to the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: We could also deploy it on a local testnet which can be started via <code>aeproject node</code></p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3.1. Create a wallet</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If we do not yet have a wallet which will be used for deployment we need to generate ourselves one:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aecli account create &lt;WALLET_NAME></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>Note: To quickly test all of Aeternity's blockchain features from your Terminal, you can Install and use our NodeJS CLI by running:\n\nnpm i -g @aeternity/aepp-cli\naecli --help</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>3.2. Fund the wallet</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We will get some testnet AE tokens from the <a href=\"https://faucet.testnet.aepps.com\">faucet</a>, so we can deploy the contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3.3. Get our private key</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to be deploying via the command-line interface (CLI), so we will need to have our private key to pass it to the deployer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get our private key:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aecli account address &lt;WALLET_NAME> --privateKey</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>3.4. Deploy to testnet</h4>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>aeproject deploy -n testnet -s &lt;SECRET_KEY> --compiler https://latest.compiler.aepps.com</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Interaction with the contract</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are multiple we can interact with our contract. The first and most easier is to use one of the online IDEs available out there &#8211; contracts.aeternity.art, fireeditor etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>4.1. Online IDE.</h4>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>contracts.aeternity.art &#8211; we put our contract code in the editor and we can access our contract by adding the address in the <code>&lt;Address&gt;</code> field so we can interact with it.<br> <code>set</code> &#8211; for setting a new value in the smart contract we have to make a stateful call (which modifies the state and costs gas)<br><code>get</code> &#8211; our getter we can access by calling static function.<br></li><li>fireeditor.nikitafuchs.de &#8211; Same as above we can put our contract code and access the freshly deployed contract <strong>at address</strong>.<br></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h4>4.2. via the SDK</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We can access our contract instance via this simple command and start interacting with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><code>await sdk.getContractInstance(CONTRACT_SOURCE, { contractAddress: OUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS} );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course we will first have to set up our project and intialize the SDK there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Fully-fledged Decentralized app</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>5.1. Set up frontend</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to setup our simple fronted we will use the waellet boilerplate repo which is pre-configured to communicate with the waellet extension and has the aeternity javascript sdk already prepared there. </p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>git clone https://github.com/waellet/waellet-aepp-boilerplate &amp;&amp; cd\nnpm install</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h4>5.2. Add the contract interface (or the full contract code)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to add our contract interface in the app, so we can call the correct methods and encode the transactions properly. This is similar to the ABI in Solidity for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-1024x460.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1763\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-1024x460.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-300x135.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-768x345.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25-1038x466.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-19-at-8.06.25.png 1310w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>https://github.com/waellet/waellet-aepp-boilerplate/blob/23419a910f668069990f96b775bd119aba70f8d3/src/views/Home/Index.vue#L204-L216</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>5.3.

You may all have heard of the CryptoKitties and Rare Pepe trading cards as the most popular form of blockchain art, but if we dig deep down into what really blockchain can do for the art industry, it’s not merely CryptoKitties.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"#authenticity-problem\">Authenticity</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#Fractional-ownership\">Fractional ownership</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#Digital-ownership\">Digital ownership </a>&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"#Invest-in-artist\">Invest in artist</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><p id=\"authenticity-problem\"><strong>Authenticity problem</strong></p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>An article published by The Daily Beast shows that 50 % of the art in circulation is fake. That means everything from the artist, the painting to the origin and region can be forged. And since Blockchain is all about transparency and building trust, people came up with a solution to deal with this issue. In order to prove authenticity, artists now can attach gadgets (like the one your dog might have to avoid being lost) to their artwork and later being scanned for all the information a collector needs to prove provenance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Blockchain development is still in progress and is yet not time-tested so problem can occur in a matter of safety. The problem here might be in the IoT devices that have a public key that is generated by the manufacturer, which is creating conditions for duplications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"Fractional-ownership\"><strong>Fractional ownership</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>By breaking to small fragments the monolithic painting and tokenizing it, sellers are able to fragment the ownership of the artwork using blockchain. Surprisingly, people get excited to participate in a new model of ownership and let’s say own a fraction of Andy Warhol’s “14 Small Electric Chairs”. This innovation improves valuation of artwork because of the interest it can attract.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using fractional ownership, people who have never been associated as collectors, can get involved in the art market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"Digital-ownership\"><strong>Digital ownership&nbsp;</strong><br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contrary to what is said above, we actually get to talk about Cryptokitties. What they’re really showing us is the fact that people do not want to buy traditional art and what they are buying is a new form of digital collectible. People are actually ok with buying things that can not be touched and exist only in a&nbsp; digital environment, but are interesting and innovative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you need to know that is you don’t actually own the image, but the code and it gives you the right only to trade or sell it.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><p id=\"Invest-in-artist\"><strong>Invest in artist</strong><br></p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creators can tokenize themselves, putting them on the market place. It’s like stock market for artist and you can invest in their career.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investing in an artist sets a kind of relationship which could be defined by a smart contract, describing what percеntage the investor owns, for what period of time and how dividends are distributed. Binding it with smart contracts about the artist’s artwork sale, investors obtain a&nbsp; percentage of the profit or investors buy tokens and later getting a discount of the artwork’s price.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participаnts’s job is to set the terms that suit them the most, as long as cryptocurrency is paid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology is making us change the concept of how we interact with the surrounding world. It changes artwork outview, making it easier, more transparent and in interesting way, developing new manners of creating and trading art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain wants to be the parsley of every dish and one of the many fields of expression is the art [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"18","title":"Blockchain and Business","path":"/category/blockchain-and-business/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"},"featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/blockchain_art.png","altText":"Blockchain in Art"}}},{"node":{"date":"2019-12-24T14:58:02","id":"1672","title":"How are smart contracts and blockchain adding value to my business?","path":"/blog/how-are-smart-contracts-and-blockchain-adding-value-to-my-business/","content":"\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/smart_contracts_business_value-1024x597.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1709\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/smart_contracts_business_value-1024x597.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/smart_contracts_business_value-300x175.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/smart_contracts_business_value-768x448.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/smart_contracts_business_value-987x576.png 987w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/smart_contracts_business_value.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Blockchain Smart Contracts</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are a young entrepreneur or someone who has run a business for years, you certainly have come across obligations or procedures that take a lot of your time and effort. We have just two words for you – Blockchain technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blockchain technology has the potential to solve some very basic business problems and can change the way you run your business by saving you time, guarantee your safety and transparency, reducing costs and the risk of fraud.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>A <em><a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/\">smart contract</a> </em>is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions by completely eliminating third parties (middleman) or any rent-seeking the third party. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Here are some problems Blockchain can solve to improve your business:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Banking</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of queuing for hours in the bank just to send money for a fine, tax, fee or purchase you can do the transferring through blockchain applications. Regardless of the amounts, the process is easier, reduces the transaction cost significantly and is a secure alternative to traditional bank transfers.  This is especially true if you are transferring funds overseas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Let’s  say you have to purchase goods for the sum of 100 000,00 USD. Making a transaction via a bank will cost 1,5% of the amount (1 500 USD), 4 business days and 30 minutes in the bank. Now if you make a transaction of the same amount through a blockchain-based application, the commission of 0,0001% saves you 1 499.90 USD.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Paying Employees</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is\nbest known for cryptocurrency, so it is completely natural to be used as a\nmethod of payment. Instead of transferring wages through banks, it can be used\nas a Bitcoin-based payroll service to reduce the time it takes for such funds\nto move from bank to bank. Payments made via Bitcoin can save both money and\ntime for both employers and employees.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Supply Chain</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwing to the blockchain and special devices, entrepreneurs and clients\ncan know track &nbsp;the goods, know in which\ncondition they are stored and when will they arrive. That makes it easier to\nconfirm the origin of the product, which builds trust between seller and buyer\nand declines the risk of fraud.\n\n\n\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, every product is traceable and it can be maintained a record of the supply chain management so if a product is lost midway it can be found again. If you want to know more about the supply chain, you can read our article <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain/\">“Blockchain in Supply chain”</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Smart contracts</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p> Using smart contract allows you to sell, exchange shares, money, documents without the use of intermediary services such as brokers, notaries, agents, etc to make a transaction which saves you time and costs. Smart contracts can also help solve the mistrust issue between business partners by writing in the code <em>If – Then </em>statements (conditions) so that the algorithm first checks if everything is fulfilled to define action.  <br><br>Furthermore, every smart contract you make is transparent which gives you extra trustworthiness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit of using&nbsp;smart contracts and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/blockchain-software-development/\">blockchain technology</a> for businesses&nbsp;come in the form of speed, cost, safety, and precision. Smart contracts are one of the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/decentralized-applications-development/\">applications of blockchain</a> that can vastly help companies in securing deals and helping run more full-fledged businesses.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Whether you are a young entrepreneur or someone who has run a business for years, you certainly have come across [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"18","title":"Blockchain and Business","path":"/category/blockchain-and-business/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"},"featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/smart_contracts_business_value.png","altText":"blockchain smart contracts business value"}}},{"node":{"date":"2019-11-20T14:03:40","id":"1683","title":"0x0f.
