When it does, it will mean greater transaction privacy, efficiency and crucially, it will unlock the potential for smart contracts, a key feature of its blockchain technology that eliminates middlemen from even the most complex transactions. Taproot is the most significant upgrade to the bitcoin network since the <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/optimizing-segwit-bitcoins-new-software-giving-scaling-boost\">block size increase</a> in 2017 and it has been widely anticipated as a major first step toward solving bitcoin&#8217;s lack of privacy and other related concerns. But what is Taproot, and how will it benefit bitcoin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What is Taproot?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taproot is a soft fork that improves Bitcoin’s scripts to increase privacy and improve upon other factors related to complex transactions on the Bitcoin Network (including timelock releases, multi-signature requirements, and others).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without Taproot, anyone can detect transactions that use those complex functionalities, which require the creation of multiple transactions. However, the Taproot upgrade will make it possible to &#8220;cloak&#8221; all the moving parts of a bitcoin transaction that includes these features, making it look like a single transaction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Taproot makes it possible to hide the fact that a Bitcoin script ran at all. For example, spending Bitcoin using Taproot could make a transaction in a Lightning Network channel, a peer-to-peer transaction, or a sophisticated smart contract become indistinguishable, making anyone monitoring one of these transactions see nothing but a peer-to-peer transaction. It&#8217;s worth noting, though, that this doesn&#8217;t change the fact that the wallets of the initial sender and final recipient will be exposed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taproot is expected to be implemented along with another upgrade called Schnorr signatures. This not only makes Taproot&#8217;s implementation possible but also enables a much-anticipated feature called &#8220;signature aggregation&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What are Schnorr signatures?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Schnorr signatures consist of a cryptographic signature scheme developed by Claus Schnorr – a German mathematician and cryptographer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin currently uses the <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/ECDSA\">ECDSA</a> algorithm to generate cryptographic signatures for a given message and <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1\">secp256k1</a> keypair. Schnorr is an alternative algorithm with several key advantages. One is that when multiple keys are used to sign the same message with Schnorr, the resulting signatures can be combined into a single signature. This means that the signatures from the multiple parties involved in a complex bitcoin transaction can be “aggregated” into a single Schnorr signature &#8211; known as signature aggregation. This can be used to significantly reduce the size of multisig payments and other multisig related transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among a number of other benefits, Schnorr signatures are primarily known for their simplicity and efficiency in generating short signatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Benefits of Taproot for Bitcoin</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When combined with Schnorr signatures, Taproot will bring major improvements to bitcoin’s privacy. This will allow wallets with more complex spending conditions, like a multisig wallet or one that uses time-locking, to no longer be distinguishable from simple single signature wallets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides enhanced privacy, other potential benefits include:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reduced transaction fees &#8211; </strong>The transaction data size for making complex Bitcoin transactions will be dramatically reduced. That means transaction fee costs for using more complex Bitcoin wallet features (such as multisig, or time-locking) will decrease significantly leading to much cheaper transaction fees from your bitcoin multisig wallet.;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More wallet functionality &#8211; </strong>A new type of signature will enhance smart contract functionality in Bitcoin, making it easier and cheaper for users to set more complicated conditions for a transaction.<strong>;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Higher TPS rate &#8211; </strong>More transactions per block.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Closing thoughts</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taproot is one highly anticipated and widely supported upgrade to Bitcoin. It is considered the biggest most important makeover since 2017 and it gets implemented along with Schnorr signatures, we will see significant improvements in terms of privacy, scalability, security, and more. These upgrades can also generate more interest around the Blockchain Network and encourage multisig to be more of an industry standard.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The first bitcoin makeover in four years has been approved by miners around the world!

In other words, it is one of its kind and you can not duplicate it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To read more about what NFTs are read our article: <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-nfts-in-art/\"><strong>Blockchain NFTs in Art</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the steady and rapid rise in popularity and purchases of cryptocurrencies for the past year or so, it should come as no surprise that the NFT market is growing rapidly as well since NFTs can be purchased with crypto. Nowadays more and more people are opting to purchase(buy or sell) these one-of-a-kind tokens and this is provable with some&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>statistics:&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The market cap for global transactions of NFTs was $40.96 million in 2018, $141.56 million in 2019, and $338.04 million in 2020.;</li><li>In 2021, an NFT called &#8220;Everyday&#8217;s: The First 5,000 Days&#8221; by an artist named Beeple was auctioned off for about $69 million.;</li><li>Big-name brands, such as Taco Bell, have started offering NFTs of their own by creating digital collectables for sale.;</li><li>By March 2021, trading volumes for NFTs on Ethereum totalled more than $400 million.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Although a lot of positive things can be said about NFTs, and many people predict that their value will continue to grow over time, there are also critics who have made it a point to alert people to the potential drawbacks of these digital assets which come with such huge price tags. Some critics argue that NFTs are not going to be able to hold their value for the long run and some even go so far as to say that NFTs aren’t worth anything at all. Many even compare them to the early adoption of the internet and that it is just a fad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>But still, what&#8217;s driving people to invest from hundreds of dollars to millions on NFTs?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the impact of the pandemic and distrust in the US dollar created the perfect storm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the start of the pandemic, many people have been saving money and the faith in the US dollar seems to be at an all-time low, which led people to search for new ways of investing. Cryptocurrencies suddenly became something everyone was interested in, automatically turning NFTs from a hobby only for the financial nerds to something fancy and mainstream. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>People have long used art to store value and NFTs just happen to be another more modern approach for people to invest and use it like someone would use gold or Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the idea that one can actually own a piece of creation (music, meme, post, digital painting, game assets, etc) is a whole another level of ownership for fans, collectors and enthusiasts which makes NFTs the perfect solution for owning something you really like or you think will be more valuable with time, or as Rodriguez-Fraile once said : </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>NFTs can represent the future of the art world.</p><p> A few years from now this could just be how people own art.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing is, NFT’s boom was accelerated by the pandemic, but ultimately it was inevitable as it is a product of the new tech that younger generations would have eventually driven into anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>But what about their value?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some critics believe NFTs are operating under a bubble, even Mike Winkelmann, aka <a href=\"https://www.beeple-crap.com/\">Beeple</a>, once said:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If it&#8217;s not a bubble now, I do believe it probably will be a bubble at some point because there are just so many people rushing into this space.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is, there&#8217;s always a chance that a tech frenzy is a passing fad or is stoking a speculative bubble. If you spend a pretty penny on an NFT and then enthusiasm and values suddenly plummet, you could be in for a big loss. But NFT backers say the system&#8217;s built-in scarcity should keep values up, as long as the surge of interest persists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the risks with value are basically the same as in the regular market. If someone is willing to pay thousands of dollars for a <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/lifestyle/why-a-banana-duct-taped-to-a-wall-sold-for-120-000-1.4719724\">banana taped to a wall</a>, then that is modern, interesting and is considered art. The price covering of NFTs art is working with the same mechanism as the regular art, only a bit fancier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What do you get when you buy an NFT?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you are a fan of Beeple&#8217;s work and you want to own artwork from him. Now, what you will actually &#8220;own&#8221; if you purchase let&#8217;s say &#8220;<a href=\"https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/100010001\">Crossroads</a>&#8221; for example, is not the creation itself, but rather a token that connects your name with the creator&#8217;s art on the blockchain. In other words, you’re paying for an extremely small digital record (likely only a few bytes in size, which often contains a URL or a serial number) that’s sent to your address on the blockchain. That’s it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you buy an NFT you gain the rights to the unique token (but only on the blockchain). So you can own it on the blockchain, but you have no control over rights to its distribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the digital non-fungible tokens operate on the same deflationary principles as bitcoin. NFTs cannot be duplicated, can be easily authenticated, and are immutable. This motivates people to buy NFTs because it provides a unique connection to the creator that does not exist with any other art form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying NFTs is all about scarcity. Blockchain provides proof of ownership and guarantees you that a specific item is unique &#8211; kind of like a certificate of authenticity and if you own that NFT, nobody else can own it unless you sell (or give) it to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, even though NFTs are essentially just a code that identifies a digital asset and its owner, they have quickly become collectors’ items, with people willing to spend hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars to stake their claim to a file. The fact that these digital assets are scarce helps them maintain their value, and that’s also one of the reasons why they cost so much money. Whether they will continue to grow in popularity and usage or eventually become a thing of the past is something that’s yet to be seen.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Simply put, NFT stands for a non-fungible token which is a digital asset that is distinctive from the others out [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"18","title":"Blockchain and Business","path":"/category/blockchain-and-business/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"},"featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/1-1.png","altText":""}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-06-07T10:20:20","id":"3242","title":"Stablecoin Explained","path":"/blog/stablecoin-explained/","content":"\n<p>Cryptocurrencies such as <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/bitcoin-101/what-is-bitcoin\">Bitcoin</a> and <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/learn/ethereum-101/what-is-ethereum\">Ethereum</a> offer a number of benefits, and one of the most fundamental is not requiring trust in an intermediary institution to send payments, which opens up their use to anyone around the world. But one key drawback is that cryptocurrencies’ prices are unpredictable and have a tendency to vary, sometimes widely and rapidly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>So, what is stablecoin?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“A Stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is tied to an outside asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold, to stabilize the price.”</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A stablecoin is a digital asset that remains stable in value against a pegged external traditional asset class. It reduces the price volatility by backing its value against a conventional asset, such as a combination of currencies, a single fiat currency, or other valuable assets. Stablecoins aim to create a stable and reliable environment to increase cryptocurrencies&#8217; adoption and negate digital assets&#8217; speculative nature. They offer the best of both worlds — security and decentralization of cryptocurrencies, with fiat currencies&#8217; stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>But, why the need for stablecoins?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-2-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3260\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-2-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-2-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/2-2.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Adopting cryptocurrencies as a direct replacement for conventional fiat currency requires stability; else the volatile currency can compromise the purchasing power of a holder. With Stablecoins one has no need to worry about volatility or instability of cryptocurrencies prices and can guarantee:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Little to no volatility &#8211; </strong>The price of cryptocurrencies doesn&#8217;t fluctuate as frequently as popular cryptos like Bitcoin or Ether.;</li><li><strong>Global payment and remittance &#8211; </strong>Cross-border transactions with stablecoins are faster, cheaper, and more efficient than the traditional methods. They are not only costly but also take days to clear a single international payment. That is a lot of unnecessary weight and fees for payments, which could be simplified using stablecoins.;</li><li><strong>Protecting cryptocurrency traders &#8211; </strong>Stablecoins also protects traders and investors during volatile markets. In a bear market, they can protect their position by flipping their Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies to a stablecoin within seconds.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Types of stablecoin</strong>:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fiat-collateralized stablecoins</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Fiat-collateralized stablecoins are, as the name suggests, backed by sovereign currency such as the pound or the US dollar. These are the most common types of stablecoins backed at a 1:1 ratio, meaning one stablecoin can be exchanged with one unit of currency. For each stablecoin that exists, there is fiat currency held in the treasury to back it up. The aim is to back a stablecoin by real fiat in real bank accounts. Though this stablecoin&#8217;s category is most simple, it is the most centralized, too. A central entity acts as the fiat reserve custodian and manages the whole process of issuing fiat-backed tokens and receiving new fiats.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Crypto-Backed stablecoins</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A crypto-backed stablecoin operates just like a fiat-backed stablecoin. However, instead of using fiat as collateral, cryptocurrencies are locked up as collateral that backs up the crypto-backed stablecoin. The token used to back the stablecoin uses a &#8216;security pledge&#8217; to compensate for the price fluctuation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Non-Collateralized (Algorithmic) stablecoin</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-collateralized stablecoins are those that do not involve the use of any reserve asset. Instead, their stability is derived from an algorithm-generated mechanism (or smart contracts)</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Commodity-backed stablecoins</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Interchangeable assets, like precious metals, back commodity-backed stablecoins. The most common commodity used to back these stablecoins is gold, but they can also be backed by real estate, oil, or other precious metals. The collateral is often stored in a vault of a trusted third party. The stablecoins entitle a purchase to redeem the coin with a commodity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Most popular stablecoins</strong>:</h2>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Tether</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tether.to/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Tether</a> is one of the oldest stablecoins, launched in 2014, and is the most popular to this day. It’s currently one of the most valuable cryptocurrencies overall by market capitalization and its primary use case is moving money between exchanges quickly and taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities when the price of cryptocurrencies differs on two exchanges. Traders can make money on this discrepancy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Diem</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.diem.com/en-us/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Diem</a> is a stablecoin in the works, originally conceived by the worldwide social media platform Facebook. Initially, the Diem Association, the consortium set up by Facebook, said Diem would be backed by a “basket” of currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the euro. But due to global regulatory concerns, the association has since backed off from its ambitious original vision. Instead, it is now planning to focus on developing multiple stablecoins, each backed by a separate national currency.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>USD Coin</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Launched in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.centre.io/usdc\" class=\"rank-math-link\">USD Coin</a> is a stablecoin managed jointly by the cryptocurrency firms Circle and Coinbase through the Centre consortium. Like Tether, USD Coin is pegged to the U.S. dollar. It is the second-largest stablecoin by market capitalization.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Dai</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Running on the MakerDAO protocol, <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/price/dai\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Dai</a> is a stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Created in 2015, the cryptocurrency aims to keep its value as close to one United States dollar (USD) as possible through an automated system of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Dai is maintained and regulated by <a href=\"https://makerdao.com/en/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">MakerDAO</a>, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) composed of the owners of its governance token, who may vote on changes to certain parameters in its smart contracts in order to ensure the stability of Dai.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>DOGEO</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-2-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3261\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-2-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-2-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6-2.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dogecoin.com/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Dogecoin</a> was created in 2013 purely as a joke to reference the internet&#8217;s favourite Shiba Inu dog <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doge\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"rank-math-link\">meme</a>. Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin\" class=\"rank-math-link\">DOGE</a>) is expected to soon be available for use as collateral in minting the dollar-pegged $DOGEO stable coin at <a href=\"http://opendao.io\">OpenDAO</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The future of stablecoins</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stablecoins have existed in the cryptocurrency space for a few years, but only gained prominence in the last year or so. Even though they are relatively new their purpose can go way beyond being just a financial contract.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are talking here about the evolution of the traditional payment system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is now a new form of digital money controlled algorithmically instead of a central authority that offers similar monetary benefits as fiat currencies. Stablecoins have the potential to open new doors to the mainstream adoption of digital assets in our day-to-day life, changing the global payment landscape (for good).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, stablecoins are in their infancy, and it may take a while before we see them used in the digital space, but it sure sounds like they are here to stay.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum offer a number of benefits, and one of the most fundamental is not requiring [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"18","title":"Blockchain and Business","path":"/category/blockchain-and-business/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"},"featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/7-1.png","altText":""}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-06-01T10:55:43","id":"3203","title":"What matters more: Blockchain or Bitcoin?","path":"/blog/what-matters-more-blockchain-or-bitcoin/","content":"\n<h3><strong>A very very brief definition</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Blockchain</a> is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrency (among other things). <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bitcoin.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Bitcoin</a> is the name of the best-known cryptocurrency, the one for which blockchain technology was invented.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>So, the question is:&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>What matters more: the technology or the creation, which this technology was invented for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer this question first, and foremost, we have to compare the two<strong> </strong>on a general indicator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see what potentials and benefits Blockchain and Bitcoin have, we have to consider their impact on a specific, real-world environment. We choose the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-best-use-case-series-blockchain-in-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Financial System</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Bitcoin Potential&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To explain Bitcoin we have to think of it as software. A software program that allows people to securely transfer money over the internet without a bank institution. It does this by replacing the function of a bank with a network of computers running the software that verifies and transfers the money. These computers, known as miners, maintain a global ledger of transactions that are used to validate, verify and transfer money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin’s most important potential is that it takes the global ledger of transactions out of the control of the banking system and distributes it onto every computer that is connected to the Bitcoin network. This means that the financial behemoths no longer control the system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Bitcoin, the users of the financial system are in control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitcoin accomplishes this disruption not just by using blockchain technology but also with the global decentralized currency &#8211; bitcoin.&nbsp;The currency &#8220;bitcoin&#8221; is the motivation for anyone in the world to run the software that changes the way the financial system works. Banks cherish blockchain because they get to continue to maintain the ledger of transactions by running the software on their own computers.&nbsp;But bitcoin creates competition for the banks in the form of anyone with a computer and an internet connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without the currency, there would be no incentive for people to spend money on computers and hardware needed to run the Bitcoin software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain without Bitcoin mimics the same financial system already in existence.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Blockchain Potential</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From a financial perspective, it’s easier to think of blockchain technology also as some kind of next-generation financial process improvement software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized technology, such as blockchain, promises the ability to improve the financial processes that occur between parties, radically lowering the “cost of trust” and drastically increasing the efficiency and transparency factors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology has the potential to provide a much faster, cheaper, and more efficient alternative to traditional cross-border payment methods. Indeed, while typical money remittance costs might be as high as 20% of the transfer amount, blockchain allows for costs just a fraction of that, as well as guaranteed and real-time transaction processing speeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Smart Contracts</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts are another highly powerful application of blockchain technology for the financial sector. Their potential applications are essentially limitless and can oversee all aspects of an agreement, from facilitation to execution. When conditions are met, smart contracts can be self-executing and self-enforcing allowing a more secure, more automated alternative to traditional contract law as well as providing an application that is faster and cheaper than the traditional methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Security</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most problematic areas of the digital age has been identity security. The financial sector is one of the many institutions maintaining online personal information and securing private information. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is known to offer a tremendous level of security, thanks to the independent verification processes that take place throughout member computers on a blockchain network called &#8220;<a href=\"https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-is-a-blockchain-consensus-algorithm\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Consensus mechanisms</a>&#8220;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, you may wonder how a consensus is achieved if these networks are composed of individual nodes operated by independent people or organizations, separated geographically and independent of each other or any central authority. How is it possible to reliably know which nodes are supplying faulty information about transactions — either maliciously or by accident?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, <em><a href=\"https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/byzantine-fault-tolerance-explained\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Byzantine Fault Tolerance </a>(BFT) </em>refers to the property of a distributed computer system that allows it to overcome this problem and consistently form consensus regardless of the fact that some nodes disagree with the rest, either accidentally or on purpose. This can be achieved by applying <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Proof-of-Work</a> or (the most recent one) <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Proof-of-Stake</a> algorithms which allow the decentralized system to ultimately determine the level of security, speed and scalability of the network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This mechanism could just easily be applied to many types of verification procedures, including identity verification and many other applications regarding financial systems. To fulfil security requirements blockchain technology makes use of public-key cryptography to grant an ownership tool that is also referred to as the <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp\" class=\"rank-math-link\">private key</a>. The cryptography that secures blockchain is deemed to be powerful enough to give it the qualities of being tamper-proof and immutable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to point out that blockchain cannot exist outside a network of computers, which automatically eliminates most system risks that are mainly associated with centralized systems. The benefits of storing data across peer-to-peer networks guarantee security and immutability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>So what does it all mean?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering the potentials that Blockchain and Bitcoin bring to just one industry&#8230; it&#8217;s safe to say that one cannot live without the other. By combining them together in one synergy, we might witness the creation of a self–sustaining independent financial system that has never existed in the modern financial world before. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, it&#8217;s likely that financial experts and many others in the investing world will encounter blockchain technology much more in the years to come, whether it is linked with a specific cryptocurrency or if it&#8217;s being utilized in a number of other applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can end this article with Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey&#8217;s words &#8220;Blockchain and Bitcoin point to a future, and point to a world, where content exists forever, where it’s permanent, where it doesn’t go away and it exists forever on every single node that’s connected to it.&#8221;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>A very very brief definition Blockchain is the technology that enables the existence of cryptocurrency (among other things).

The main distinguishing features of them are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>They improve on older cryptocurrencies by placing privacy at the core of their new design</li><li>They aren’t backward compatible since they’re a whole new cryptocurrency</li><li>They have inherently higher complexity</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, so good. Those new privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies sound like a nice deal, what are some real-world examples then? Well, let’s point out the most prominent ones and then analyze them closer. We’ll be scratching on Zerocoin, Zerocash, and Monero.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zerocoin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one, <a href=\"http://zerocoin.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Zerocoin</a>, is more of a protocol-oriented project. Quoting its creators as to what its aim is: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Zerocoin is a project to fix a major weakness in Bitcoin: the lack of privacy guarantees we take for granted in using credit cards and cash. Our goal is to build a cryptocurrency where your neighbors, friends, and enemies can’t see what you bought or for how much.</p><cite>Zerocoin website</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This very cool statement is backed by the mixing capability implemented in the <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6547123\" class=\"rank-math-link\">protocol</a> itself. Now, let’s open  Zerocoin’s hatch and see how its gears turn. The main idea is that there are two types of coins &#8211; a Basecoin (Bitcoin or some other altcoin) and a Zerocoin which serves as an extension of the Basecoin. Basecoins can be swapped for Zerocoins and vice versa. If you go back to the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/lets-talk-blockchain/cryptocurrencies-and-privacy/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">first part</a> of this post, you will see that this serves pretty much the same purpose as coin mixing and it aims to remove the linkability of the initial Basecoins. You can find a rough visualization of what happens when using only the Basecoin vs Basecoin + Zerocoin. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"333\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-1024x333.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3116\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-1024x333.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-300x97.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-768x250.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-1536x499.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability-1038x337.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-1full-linkability.png 1828w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Transaction linkability of a Basecoin(BTC) vs. Zerocoin</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea consists of two parts: initially, a user converts a Basecoin into a Zerocoin, and then, in the future, the same user can use the Zerocoin to turn it back into a Basecoin. The protocol guarantees a curious user can’t find out exactly which Zerocoin was used to create a Basecoin, hence the initial “creator” of the Zerocoin can’t be linked. The first part (minting) is achieved through a classical cryptographic commitment. To mint a Zerocoin, a user must generate a serial number <strong><em>S</em></strong> which will be used in the future to spend the Zerocoin (this prevents double-spending), and a random secret <strong><em>r</em></strong> which must remain private (this enforces the unlinkability when spending). The commitment then is calculated as <em><strong>c := g^(S) * h^(r)</strong> </em>(<strong><em>g</em></strong> and <strong><em>h</em></strong> being hash functions) which ensures that neither <strong><em>S</em></strong> nor <strong><em>r</em></strong> can be computed by only knowing the commitment <strong><em>c</em></strong>. Once this is done, a user posts the commitment together with the hash of the Basecoin which they wish to convert to Zerocoin, and if the Basecoin is owned by them, then the minting transaction is accepted and posted on the blockchain.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"272\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-1024x272.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3117\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-1024x272.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-300x80.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-768x204.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-1536x408.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing-1038x275.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-2minfing.png 1828w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Zerocoin minting process</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, unlinkability hasn’t been achieved. This is done in the second part (spending). To accomplish this, the protocol utilizes several techniques, one of which is an accumulator. A closer look at how accumulators operate is shown below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"642\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-1024x642.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3118\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-1024x642.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-300x188.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-768x481.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators-919x576.png 919w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-3accumulators.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Basic overview of an accumulator function</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, the accumulator in the Zerocoin protocol is used for accumulating every mint transaction on the blockchain as part of the spending phase. So, after this slight technical detour, let’s look at how Alice can spend her Zerocoins while maintaining unlinkability.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Firstly, she would have to publish the serial number <strong><em>S</em></strong> she generated at the minting phase &#8211; remember that <strong><em>c := g^(S) * h^(r)</em></strong> </li><li>Then, she should accumulate all previously minted Zerocoins (their commitments) on the blockchain &#8211; <strong><em>a</em></strong></li><li>After that, Alice will compute the public witness <strong><em>w</em></strong> for her coin</li><li>Lastly, she must create a ZKP stating that &#8220;she knows a random secret <strong><em>r</em></strong> such that a coin <strong><em>c</em></strong> is one of the minted Zerocoins”. She keeps <strong><em>r</em></strong> and <strong><em>c</em></strong> secret, of course. <br><br>The ZKP is the interesting part since it uses a logical disjunction of ZKPs for all of the Zerocoins and the whole ZKP is evaluated as true if one ZKP is valid while not revealing exactly which ZKP is valid.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-1024x577.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3119\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-1024x577.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-768x433.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP-1023x576.png 1023w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-4ZKP.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Process of computing a disjunction of ZKPs</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the protocol itself doesn’t guarantee absolute unlinkability if used poorly. For once, if there are only a few people using Zerocoins, then the overall ZKP from step 4 would result in very fragile unlinkability. Another point of failure is user habits. The effectiveness of the protocol depends on the users making smart decisions, meaning that if a single user mints a Zerocoin from one address and then simply spends a Zerocoin from the same address, nothing is achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Zerocash</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you visit Zerocoin’s official website, you will see the information that the protocol has been succeeded by a fully functional project called <a href=\"https://z.cash/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Zerocash</a>. So, what are the improvements?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main change is that Zerocash runs on its own and doesn’t need a Basecoin to function. Additionally, it relies on better cryptographic proof techniques (zk-SNARKs). At its core, Zerocash makes use of the notion that there are 2 address types &#8211; private (z-addresses) and transparent (t-addresses) ones which allow 4 different transaction types.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-1024x375.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3120\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-1024x375.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-300x110.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-768x281.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses-1038x380.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-5z-addresses.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Zcash transaction types</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The most interesting of these 4 transaction types If the Z-to-Z transaction which quoting Zerocash’s website is specified as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>A Z-to-Z transaction appears on the public blockchain, so it is known to have occurred and that the fees were paid. But the addresses, transaction amount, and the memo field are all encrypted and not publicly visible. This type of encryption is only possible through the use of zero-knowledge proofs.<br>The owner of an address may choose to disclose z-address and transaction details with trusted third parties — think auditory and compliance needs — through the use of view keys and payment disclosure.</p><cite>Zerocash website</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, Zerocash looks better than Zerocoin, but it also has some drawbacks. The main one being the inherent need for a secret random input needed to generate public parameters during the setup phase and the importance of these inputs being securely destroyed. The reason for this is if someone gets ahold of those secrets, then that person could <a href=\"http://zerocash-project.org/q_and_a#can-one-put-a-backdoor-in-zerocash\" class=\"rank-math-link\">forge</a> coins arbitrarily. This hasn’t happened yet, so we can assume the system has been safe so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Monero</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if we are looking for a cryptocurrency that is even stricter when it comes to privacy. How about something along these lines:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It’s a set of open-source privacy-focused protocols that were initially built upon Bytecoin/CryptoNode code</li><li>There’s an accepted hard-fork approximately twice a year used as a testing environment for new functions</li><li>The community interest is increasing constantly and it’s very well maintained</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, this is <a href=\"https://www.getmonero.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Monero</a> for you. It has its roots in this famous bitcointalk forum <a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=563821.0\" class=\"rank-math-link\">thread</a>. Nowadays, Monero developers have implemented several very important features that make the cryptocurrency arguably the best privacy-oriented one out there: it provides stealth addresses which aren’t the typical public addresses as in other cryptos, the transaction information is confidential meaning the transacted amounts aren&#8217;t publicly visible, and it utilizes ring signatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look at the first feature, <strong><em>stealth addresses</em></strong>. Most cryptocurrencies promote the usage of a new address for every payment, however, this has often proven to be ineffective in maintaining privacy. Firstly, due to the work in modern heuristics that aim to link addresses and secondly, because at some point one user has to communicate an address to another user or service. This is why Monero tackled this problem by creating a new address management system. Stealth addresses function by allowing a user to post a general public “STEALTHADDR” which other users can use as a blueprint to create arbitrarily many different addresses and send coins to them. These coins will be accessible only by the user holding the private key to the blueprint “STEALTHADDR”. This way, a curious user can’t link different fresh addresses to the initial “STEALTHADDR”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The math behind this isn’t too complex. Let’s say Alice creates a pair of private keys &#8211; <em><strong>(a, b)</strong></em> and publishes a pair of public keys &#8211; <em><strong>(g^a, g^b)</strong></em>. After that, Bob can use those public keys to create as many fresh addresses as he wants and send money to Alice through those. For a new address, Bob generates a private random secret <strong><em>r</em></strong>, computes <strong><em>f = g^(a * r)</em></strong>, and then the new address would be <strong><em>P = g^(H(f)) * g^b</em></strong>. When sending coins, Bob also includes <strong><em>g^r</em></strong>. Now, Alice can compute the private key <strong><em>p</em></strong> for the new address <strong><em>P</em></strong> simply by calculating <strong><em>p = H(g^(a * r)) + b</em></strong> and spend the coins.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"249\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-1024x249.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3135\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-1024x249.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-300x73.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-768x187.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6-1038x253.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-6.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Stealth addresses</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The next important feature is <strong><em>confidential transactions</em></strong>. Monero has correctly focused on hiding the transacted amount because that piece of information is quite heavily utilized in modern linking heuristic methods. This is achieved via the homomorphic property of commitments (confidential transactions in Monero). Besides the essential hiding and binding properties, the homomorphic one is applied so that if there are, for example, 3 commitments &#8211; a single commit for 1 coin, another commit for 4 coins, and another for 6 coins, their combination would result in a single commitment for 11 coins.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"244\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-1024x244.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3123\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-1024x244.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-300x71.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-768x183.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1-1038x247.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-7-1.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Homomorphic property of a Pedersen commitment</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s now apply this to Monero’s confidential transactions in a practical example.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"261\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-1024x261.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3124\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-1024x261.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-300x76.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-768x196.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8-1038x265.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-8.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Confidential transaction example</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, for the last essential part of Monero &#8211; <strong><em>ring signatures</em></strong>. To introduce this concept, we can start off with an example of a typical Bitcoin transaction. In it, every input has a deterministic mapping to a single output. This makes the system quite simple and easy to use at the cost of enabling transaction tracking. In contrast to this approach, ring signatures provide a cryptographic mechanism that allows many outputs to be mapped to a single input. Monero basically manages to create a transaction signature via ring signatures that:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Proves that one of the secret keys was used to make a transaction</li><li>Doesn’t reveal the public key that was used in the transaction</li><li>Prevents the usage of the same public key in future transactions</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To best illustrate how this works, imagine that you are given a bucket of lego pieces that can be combined to form a circle. You also have your very own lego piece which is identical to all of the others in the bucket, but only you know that it’s your own piece. Now, you take random pieces from the bucket and, together with your piece, build a circle without anyone looking. You then take the circle, give it to someone and ask them to pick out exactly your piece. Intuitively, the success of the person depends on pure chance &#8211; the fewer pieces in the circle, the greater the chance of the person guessing which piece is exactly yours. Not only that, but if you always use the same piece, the person guessing might start noticing it, so that’s why it’s important to also use a different personal piece each time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This non-technical analogy, while basic, highlights the most essential aspects of ring signatures in Monero. For a short summary of the math behind the mechanism, you could check out the picture below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-1024x903.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3125\" width=\"1024\" height=\"903\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-1024x903.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-300x265.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-768x678.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys-653x576.png 653w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/PIC-9pub.-priv.-keys.png 1495w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Basic example of a ring signature transaction</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ongoing research focusing on privacy in cryptocurrencies is very active. As presented in the first part of this blog post, there are several viable solutions that focus on making privacy-enhancing technology compatible with current cryptocurrencies. But, many active projects have taken this a step further and succeeded in creating new cryptocurrencies which are all about keeping coin users anonymous.<br>With the risk of repeating myself, regardless of whether you think anonymity in cryptocurrencies is important or not, privacy is something that shouldn’t be neglected! It’s such a hot topic in today’s tech world for a reason. As long as cryptocurrencies continue to strive towards being a viable and even better alternative to fiat currencies, they have to at least try and be better in every aspect possible. Of course, the physical aspect of cash seems rather impossible to replicate via a blockchain. Privacy, however, is something that could and must be improved and hopefully, developers will continue to improve this aspect of the technology that is the future &#8211; cryptocurrencies!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Privacy-enhancing cryptocurrencies While the previous blog post concerned itself with privacy-enhancing Bitcoin-compatible protocols, in this one we will analyze a [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"158","title":"Lets Talk Blockchain","path":"/category/lets-talk-blockchain/"}],"author":{"name":"Aleksandar Hadzhiyski","path":"/author/aleksandar/"},"featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Cover-3.png","altText":""}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-04-29T14:46:37","id":"3053","title":"Games on Blockchain or Blockchain for Games?","path":"/blog/games-on-blockchain-or-blockchain-for-games/","content":"\n<p>The video gaming industry is huge and shows no signs of slowing down.

We wouldn&#8217;t have had the need to address problems like lack of transparency and trust in games, a decade ago, but with virtual reality (VR) and 5G data streaming capabilities became part of gaming, everything is closer to real-life than ever, turning them into a warehouse of emotion-churning, engrossing games that reward precision and planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those games are often invented with twisted plots where characters (like Super Mario) don&#8217;t just die while chasing some distant goal like a princess in a castle. Instead, players build up and customize characters by trading and buying assets that can be purchased with real-world money as an in-game purchase or earned as the player progresses in the game in order to level up and complete missions. It is like games have an economy inside them, which is completely controlled by the developers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gamers want fairness and transparency when it comes to transactions and ownership of assets, so games need to become more neutral for players who work hard or spend their money to acquire them(guns, props, environments, cars, planes, characters, and art). But since these assets are virtual, game developers can just produce an unlimited amount or rig the market by providing them to certain players, which contradicts the meaning of the games &#8211; to be fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where Blockchain comes!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain enables the tokenization of these assets and the creation of decentralized gaming asset markets. Since the ledger is open for everyone to check and verify, this increases the trust factor. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Security</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaming platforms are mainly hosted on centralized servers and transactions are often made on mobile devices or computers without adequate security measures. Also, assets held in gaming accounts are prone to be stolen. They are not as secure as bank accounts, however valuable a gaming account can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain is designed to be unhackable and is known for being the most secure way of storing value. By storing digital gaming assets on a blockchain a player would enhance the security of them and would have to worry if those hours of effort were in vain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Games on Blockchain</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Games are a great way to hook someone on new technology and for those who want to feel the nature of Blockchain, there are games developed entirely on Blockchain.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://axieinfinity.com/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Axie Infinity</a> is one of the longest-standing and most popular games on Ethereum where you collect creatures, raise them, breed them, and battle them. It has very cute graphics and it can answer the question “What would CryptoKitties be like if you could do more than just breed them?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Axie Infinity isn’t a ground-breaking use of blockchain, but it’s the best at what it does and is an accessible entry-level game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://decentraland.org/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Decentraland</a> is another game on Ethereum that launched in early 2020. The game is a decentralized virtual world that has much to offer, including unique avatars, events, custom buildings and items, and seasonal quests. Everything within the game is owned by the player, from the clothes that you create and wear to the very land that you walk on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the thing is..there is no need to put everything on-chain to reap the rewards of blockchain tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Web-1920-–-6-1-1-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3070\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Web-1920-–-6-1-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Web-1920-–-6-1-1-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Web-1920-–-6-1-1-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Web-1920-–-6-1-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Web-1920-–-6-1-1.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What goes on-chain?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, the optimum system makes use of elements both on and off-chain, working combined to provide all the benefits of blockchain in a way that is feasible within current technical boundaries and safeguards the commercial sensitivities of operators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Game developers can still keep hold of proprietary information and game logic, running this off-chain for the company&#8217;s privacy reasons. On-chain, player profiles and data, as well as game information, can be stored for the sake of those key benefits &#8211; transparency and visibility. The combination of on-chain data, derived from off-chain game logic and interactions, makes for a model that is perfect for meeting the needs of the gaming sector, for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And lets not forget one very important thing!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ownership of in-game assets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>То encourage longer playtime, developers implemented rewards for players who put in hours and hours of effort to achieve a certain objective. But despite investing time and hard-earned money into the game, the players do not own the digital assets they have built up. Developers hold the power to change or remove items as they see fit which makes players merely licensees of their product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the new blockchain-enabled development focuses on transferring the ownership of in-game assets from developers to players. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Games are even starting to flip the script and enabling players to be the true owners of their in-game assets. This is facilitated by smart contracts which mean that ownership of the digital asset is automatically passed to the player when a certain predefined condition is met (such as purchasing the asset or completing challenges). Since the data on a blockchain is immutable, the smart contract cannot be reversed by the developer. This presents a number of opportunities for players to monetize their skills and progress. For example, a tournament winner could sell or auction off their game-winning tool. With blockchain, you can trace the history of each in-game asset – and owning some champion tools would be like owning a piece of historic sports memorabilia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Closing thought</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The intersection of blockchain and gaming is an interesting world where lifelike reality is possible in a virtual world. With advances in VR, this world is more likely to be even more integrated with our real-world experience than we can imagine right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are witnessing a revolution in gaming and blockchain. Combined, they will create an ecosystem that works seamlessly,taking gaming to a completly new level.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The video gaming industry is huge and shows no signs of slowing down.

Similarly to a famous pawnshop owner bargaining on their tv show: \n<em>“Anonymity? Sorry, best I can do is pseudonymity.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a starting point, let’s define what anonymity means in the context of cryptocurrencies. The term could be explained as the sum of pseudonymity and unlinkability.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity.png\" alt=\"privacy through anonimity in cryptocurrencies\" class=\"wp-image-3024\" width=\"748\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity.png 1495w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity-300x115.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity-1024x393.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity-768x295.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-1anonymity-1038x399.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><figcaption>Anonymity in cryptocurrencies</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Those two concepts are very closely intertwined and it’s important to point out that the latter isn’t simply a nice-to-have rather an essential part. I’ve heard many times the incorrect assumption that even if one’s pseudonyms (blockchain addresses) are linked, how could that possibly lead to the person behind those pseudonyms. In reality, many cryptoasset services hold some kind of personal identifiable information (PII). All it takes is one pseudonym to be linked to the PII and the thread unravels. Let’s take a closer look at the most famous cryptocurrency &#8211; Bitcoin and why it’s not fully anonymous.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Firstly, cryptoassets built on a blockchain are public and that includes both transactions and addresses.</li><li>Secondly, addresses could be linked via clustering heuristics used in different tools such as Chainalysis, CipherTrace, and GraphSense.</li><li>Lastly, as previously mentioned, many cryptoasset services hold PII that lead back to the people behind addresses.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these points lead to the fact that transactions along with senders and recipients of payments could be linked to specific users. It’s easy to see that Bitcoin is missing the unlinkability part from the anonymity equation. Not only that but also the offered privacy is arguably worse than that of traditional banking. In the end, the underlying blockchain put together with the data saved from different exchanges creates somewhat of a privacy hell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that at this point we can agree that although the early promises and expectations from cryptoassets were for anonymity, linkable payments are the de facto status quo. Looking back at more than a decade of cryptoassets, we can observe an ever-increasing acceptance of cryptocurrencies as means of payment. However, with great power comes great responsibility. On the one side, there’s the positive increase in acceptance, while on the other side there are all of the negative news throughout the years: the shutdown of the Silk Road Darknet Marketplace, the famous Mt. Gox hack, the Bitstamp security breach, the DAO hack, the wave of Ponzi schemes and ICO scams. If you ask me, those events are inevitable for a new and emerging technology in the field of payments. Just like every new creation there still are a lot of unknowns and problems that should closely be analyzed and solved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that spirit, let’s look at the opportunities to avoid linkability in cryptocurrencies. The first approach I will analyze is the application of Bitcoin-compatible solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Coin mixing</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3025\" width=\"748\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing.png 1495w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing-300x115.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing-1024x393.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing-768x295.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-2coin-mixing-1038x399.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><figcaption>Tagged coins go in, untagged coins go out.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The basic idea of coin mixing is quite straightforward. An arbitrary amount of honest users each put the same amount of “tagged” coins as input in the mixer and wish to obtain that amount of “untagged” coin if the mixing was a success or receive back the original “tagged” coins if the mixing failed due to some reason. Of course, the described process sounds intuitively like a centralized service of sorts. There are several issues with that: the mixing service can always link coins to users and it’ll almost surely require some kind of fee. We can also mention theft by the service as a potential issue although there are protocols that can make the mixing service accountable for the number of coins (BNMCKF Mixcoin proposal). An example for a centralized trusted mixing service is bestmixer and for an untrusted mixing server &#8211; <a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/575.pdf\" class=\"rank-math-link\">TumbleBit</a>. Great, now that the shortcomings are pointed out, the logical question is: What about decentralized solutions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized mixing sounds great due to several reasons. There is no central service, theft is impossible, it provides inherently better anonymity and lastly, it follows Satoshi Nakamoto’s decentralized philosophy for Bitcoin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>CoinJoin</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The first decentralized mixing protocol to mention is the <a href=\"https://www.comsys.rwth-aachen.de/fileadmin/papers/2017/2017-maurer-trustcom-coinjoin.pdf\" class=\"rank-math-link\">CoinJoin</a> protocol. I’ll try to make a very short and non-technical summary of the protocol and if you feel it’s unjust, please excuse me. The first step is to find users who also want to mix the same amount of coins as you. After that, you exchange input and output addresses for the transactions. Every user constructs their transaction (where does the user want to send coins to), sends it around, collects signatures from the other users, and before signing (confirming the transaction) also checks that their output is present. After that, the transaction with the inputs and outputs is broadcast to the Bitcoin network. So far, this protocol fulfills the decentralization and no-theft requirements. However, it introduces another big problem. That is, if a malicious user “infiltrates” the CoinJoin group, then that user knows the input/output combinations of all the other users and has no problem sharing that information with someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>CoinShuffle</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where an improved protocol called <a href=\"https://petsymposium.org/2014/papers/Ruffing.pdf\" class=\"rank-math-link\">CoinShuffle</a> comes into play. CoinShuffle’s main improvements are that it provides unlinkability (input/output combinations aren’t linkable to users) and robustness (if there’s a malicious user, they will be exposed). CoinShuffle functions similarly to a pinboard where users willing to participate indicate that by generating cryptographic key pairs and posting the public key. It’s important to note that CoinShuffle can guarantee unlinkability and robustness as long as there are at least 2 honest users on the board. The protocol itself has two main building blocks &#8211; <em>layered encryption</em> and <em>permutation</em> that ensure it can work as intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3026\" width=\"748\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption.png 1495w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption-300x115.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption-1024x393.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption-768x295.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-3layerd-encryption-1038x399.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><figcaption>Layered encryption</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3027\" width=\"748\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation.png 1495w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation-300x115.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation-1024x393.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation-768x295.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-4permutation-1038x399.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" /><figcaption>Permutation</figcaption></figure></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So, once the protocol is initiated, each user generates an output address and has to use the key pair with which the user “joined” the board. After that, each participant uses their signature key to sign their input address + public key and post that to the board. Then, each user applies onion encryption to their output address using the public keys of the “upcoming&#8221; users and adds that to the chain of encrypted output addresses. The idea is that the different encrypted output addresses are indistinguishable by the other users since they could decrypt only one layer and so, in the end, no user can link any output address to a specific user.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3028\" width=\"914\" height=\"243\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle.png 1828w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-300x80.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-1024x272.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-768x204.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-1536x408.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PIC-5coin-shuffle-1038x275.png 1038w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 914px) 100vw, 914px\" /><figcaption>CoinShuffle shuffling phase</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the robustness, there’s no guarantee that a malicious user wouldn&#8217;t just refuse to sign the transaction when it’s their turn and thus force the mixing to fail. There is, however, a solution for that situation as well and it’s called the blaming phase. Since the cryptographic key pair used to “post” on the pinboard is created only for the current transaction, it’s no problem to reveal all private (decryption) keys in the case of a failed transaction. Following the reveal, all encryption steps are replicated and the “malicious” user whose private key is missing can be exposed and kicked from the protocol. After that, the protocol should force the remaining participants to create new Bitcoin addresses and cryptographic key pairs for improved privacy before running again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After covering those two protocols in a somewhat informal manner, we can conclude that there’s a real possibility to enhance the privacy of Bitcoin transactions while remaining fully compatible with the currency. It is safe to say that what applies to Bitcoin, can generally be used for a great number of other cryptocurrencies as well. You might be impressed by the improvement in privacy a protocol can bring and naturally ask yourself: &#8220;Well, if the protocol’s so great, why isn’t it the norm?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s simple &#8211; users can decide for themselves to ignore it and simply use the cryptocurrency as originally designed. No one can enforce the usage of privacy-enhancing protocols on a global scale. Some wallets implement them, nevertheless, a lot of users decide to perform their transactions in a “vanilla” fashion with the idea that they don’t have anything to hide so they have no problem with their transactions being linkable. Whether that’s a correct approach or not, everyone can decide for themselves. The main point is to not lose sight of the importance of privacy in today’s world and that includes the ever-growing field of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of whether you agree with the previous statement or not, there are already solutions that try to combat the inherent privacy issues found in Bitcoin and other cryptoassets. They achieve this by taking a step further than the privacy-enhancing protocols and building new cryptocurrencies with privacy at their cores. Those privacy-enhanced cryptocurrencies try to correct flaws in other cryptoassets at the cost of being inherently more complex and not having backwards compatibility. Prominent examples are Monero, Zerocoin, and Zerocash. They implement interesting improvements over older cryptocurrencies and will hopefully, continue to grow. In the <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/cryptocurrencies-and-privacy-part-2/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">second part of the blog post</a>, we will dive deeper into their details to further clarify the possibilities of keeping your data private in the world of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Privacy-enhancing Bitcoin-compatible protocols Nowadays, privacy has become such an important topic within the many technologies we use in our lives [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"158","title":"Lets Talk Blockchain","path":"/category/lets-talk-blockchain/"}],"author":{"name":"Aleksandar Hadzhiyski","path":"/author/aleksandar/"},"featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Cover-1.png","altText":"cryptocurrencies-and-privacy-1"}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-04-20T09:23:15","id":"2984","title":"Blockchain &#038; Gambling &#8211; Benefits and Challenges for the Industry","path":"/blog/blockchain-gambling-benefits-and-challenges-for-the-industry/","content":"\n<p>Blockchain is already shaping the future of many industries (for the better) and is set to be the next big technology to ring sweeping changes through sectors and the gambling industry is one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the pre-mobile days of exclusively physical, in-person gaming and gambling, nowadays online-player numbers around the world have soared, fueled hugely by advancing technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet even still, technological barriers exist within the gambling sector that holds back progress. Trust and transparency remain a significant issue for some players, and for operators, the gaming experience is reliant on often centralized systems, that are themselves vulnerable to manipulation and hacking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where blockchain comes in!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantages of blockchain and <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/smart-contracts-vs-traditional-contracts/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">smart contracts</a> can solve many issues regarding safety and fair game, as the technology allows to record anonymously user actions and game results; Faster transaction speed, because clients of blockchain-based resources can withdraw or deposit funds without waiting for several days; Anonymity, as blockchain-based crypto casinos guarantee that player personal information won’t be disseminated and more&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why does gambling need blockchain, and what are the advantages of the technology?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What benefits could blockchain offer the gambling industry?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology offers a number of unique advantages over other systems that make it such a perfect fit for gambling:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Transparency</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there’s the transparency angle. In blockchain systems, data is written automatically to a distributed ledger, which by definition provides an immutable, trusted source of truth. Blockchain gaming data can be relied upon by operators, players, and regulators, all of whom can access the same data in real-time which is helpful for resolving player trust issues and the disputes that inevitably arise along the way. But it’s also incredibly useful for operators meeting their compliance requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Security</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main opportunities blockchain provides is enhanced security. With data held on the blockchain theoretically unhackable and totally secure, information can, automatically, be considered no longer vulnerable to fraud. The decentralized nature of the technology ensures secure transactions as well as prevents data from being changed or deleted. So the history of victories and payments is not only open but also well-protected and immutable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Improved Payout Process</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As for payments, the process of withdrawal has always been a challenge. In order to get the money, one could face the necessity to deal with different documents and intermediaries as well as time delays.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blockchain technology introduces smart contracts to the gambling industry. These are programs that perform certain actions (eg. money transfer) when the required conditions are met.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, blockchain technology allows faster transaction speed as payments are conducted directly, without third parties and there is no need for clients to wait several days to withdraw their money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, empowered by blockchain, the process of getting money becomes fast, cheap and simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Cryptocurrency Availability&nbsp;</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the public mind, blockchain has always been known for cryptocurrencies and in the case of gambling, it is an appropriate association. Implementation of crypto in the betting and gambling services can widen the audience and helps to get rid of third-party intermediaries like banks or payment services.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Audience Expansion</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>People related to the industry believe that blockchain will help to make gambling more socially acceptable and, as a result, attract more users to blockchain-based betting platforms and casinos. This is the effect of the benefits we mentioned above: security, cryptocurrency availability, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-1024x445.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2999\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-1024x445.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-300x130.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-768x334.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-1536x667.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3-1038x451.png 1038w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-3.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What challenges does the gambling industry face with blockchain?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, things like anonymity can be regarded as a two-edged sword. For example, the fact that transactions can’t be traced to the real user, if no KYC is required, opens the door to the very same criminal activity the industry is trying to prevent nowadays. While blockchain services are hailed for anonymity, this feature isn’t likely to sit well with regulations. How would anonymous gambling allow for effective age checks, anti-money laundering processes, and self-exclusion facilities? These questions are fair to ask and are not something the technology is not capable of solving &#8211; for example via Zero-Knowledge Proof based systems, which would allow the user to prove they are old enough to participate in the betting platform without revealing sensitive and/or private information to the whole world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people consider the investment in bitcoin as the same as gambling in a casino. However, while gambling on games like roulette often requires an understanding of roulette odds and strategy play successfully, a similarly considered approach to investing in cryptocurrency might be futile. This is due to its sheer volatility, which can drastically drop its value in a single day. The challenge &#8211; price volatility. All cryptocurrencies, with no exceptions, are prone to price change. The value of a single unit of currency changes on a day-to-day basis exactly because the blockchain is ungoverned and decentralized. This creates a feeling of insecurity in many users and casino players, thus making them reluctant to even get started with the technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The very nature of the technology allows players to improve the fairness and transparency of online gambling. However, the regulatory issues involved in introducing blockchain could prove to be the biggest stumbling block companies face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, some places are already starting to adopt laws that allow casinos and gambling operators to accept cryptocurrencies as legal tender. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gambling Commission has already accepted that cryptocurrencies can be used for gambling. This is because it’s classed as ‘money or money’s worth’ in the Gambling Act 2005. But it has expressed concerns about how well casinos will be able to put effective controls in place that manage the various risks involved with these cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If these regulatory challenges can be overcome, it’s highly likely we’ll witness blockchain being more regularly adopted to audit, monitor, and record different parts  – from the players and operators to the games themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the potential challenges and controversies involved, blockchain is an emerging technology that cannot be ignored, particularly in technology-based businesses like online casinos. Over the next ten years or so, experts predict that blockchain will transform almost every industry – including gambling, as blockchain allows gambling to rapidly advance and enter new levels of trust-based customer relations and guarantees fair gaming, which is quite important for the industry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So stay tuned!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain is already shaping the future of many industries (for the better) and is set to be the next big [&hellip;]</p>\n","categories":[{"id":"18","title":"Blockchain and Business","path":"/category/blockchain-and-business/"}],"author":{"name":"Silvia","path":"/author/schitakova/"},"featuredMedia":{"sourceUrl":"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-1.png","altText":""}}},{"node":{"date":"2021-04-02T12:06:04","id":"2954","title":"How Blockchain is taking over the world [2021]","path":"/blog/how-blockchain-is-taking-over-the-world-2021/","content":"\n<p>Blockchain technology has to be one of the biggest innovations of the past decade. Considering it’s something that began with mere cryptocurrency, now  – it has a ripple effect on several important sectors, from manufacturing, <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-in-supply-chain-2/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">supply chain</a> to Fintech, <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/blockchain-art/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Art</a>, and education.<br>Many predict it is going to transform the nature of transactions, trading across the world, as well as transform the way we manage data, both internally and externally between parties, and most importantly build trust, transparency and change our worldview. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what makes blockchain so attractive to businesses and different industries? How is still continuing to be so hyped and controversial? And most importantly, why are there so many applications being developed on the Blockchain?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is simple &#8211; It’s because of its benefits. Blockchain offers indisputable traceability, distributed collaboration capabilities, trust, and rapid updates to support managing data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend is evidenced by ever-growing global investment in blockchain solutions, which is forecast to reach US$15.9 billion in 2023, ten times more than the $1.5 billion invested in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Southeast Asia, businesses are feeling optimistic too, with 45% of companies believing that blockchain technology growth will accelerate with more applications and opportunities over the next three to five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let’s look at more recent events &#8211; <a class=\"rank-math-link\" href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/crypto\">PayPal’s adoption of Bitcoin</a> late last year is not only heralding mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies but of blockchain’s utility in an era in which remote collaboration is prized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year has been off to a notable start for crypto and blockchain. On Jan. 7 the total cryptocurrency market hit an all-time high exceeding $1 trillion for the first time. Renewed interest in and conversations around, blockchain technology and digital currencies from industry and government leaders have accompanied the rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s new is that blockchain interoperability has gotten better, the technology itself has matured, and vendors have significantly stepped up their efforts in this area, making it more accessible and ready to take over the world for good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we made a list of&nbsp; some trends blockchain is most likely to follow in 2021:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Supply Chain Optimization</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing supply chains is crucial especially in the area of goods flow and logistics as the industries are known for their paper-heavy processes and struggle with many challenges in day-to-day business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case of international goods traffic, it is often a wide variety of systems, manual work, and cross-border specifications that make the work of logisticians and partners more difficult.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimized supply chains do not just refer to the cost-optimized shipment of good or raw materials from A to B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Long distances, many partners, large volumes of documents and data, and mutual trust can be optimally mapped digitally with blockchains and various applications. As a distributed ledger, the technology is ideally suited to managing large volumes of data raw materials that can be tracked from their origin and grant digital certificates the authenticity or accuracy of information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The integration of DLT in supply chain management is one of the top blockchain trends in 2021 because, on the one hand, the consumer’s need for transparency is growing and on the other hand, the barrier-free supply of goods across all borders ensures greater security, trust and economic stability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DeFi Adoption</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/defi-decentralized-finance/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">Decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) is experiencing a new wave of excitement and adoption since mid-December(2020) after the DeFi summer blossom. The value of DeFi tokens hit new highs, bolstering awareness of DeFi within the crypto community while <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-and-business/traditional-vs-decentralized-fundraising-models/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">attracting new users from traditional finance</a> (TraFi), enabling private small investors to enter the financial world, turning millions of people into investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Blockchain provides numerous approaches for DeFi adoption in different fields, ranging from trading, lending, derivatives, to the introduction of automated market makers. These clear winners of DeFi’s adoption have become prime targets for everyone who&#8217;s trying to take advantage of their innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Certificate verification via the blockchain</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The validity and timeliness of certificates are the basis for trust between business partners. Certificates using blockchain technology are tamper-proof and can be viewed transparently by every participant in the network. Providers of these solutions thus ensure that audits and certification, for example, can be carried out successfully. However, the digital certificates can also be proof of ownership or proof of origin. Once stored, anyone can access the relevant information with a QR code, ensuring efficient processes and user convenience during audits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital certificates are a blockchain trend 2021, as they prevent misuse and provide consumers and partners with security and trust for future business relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>DEXes (Decentralized Exchanges)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to exchanging crypto, many have long been focused on centralized players like Binance or Coinbase largely due to their fiat onramps and ease of use. Despite these notions, many have been quick to point out that centralized exchanges come with their own inherent risks – namely those of custody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Famously highlighted by hacks on once-prominent exchanges, many traders have come to recognize the value of non-custodial solutions offered by decentralized exchanges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past year alone, DEXs have made serious improvements in both usability and liquidity – signaling that they are ready to compete with their goliath counterparts. Here are some of the DEXes’s characteristics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><em>Non-custodial</em> – Ownership of the underlying assets is never revoked.</li><li><em>Automated</em> – With no intermediaries, DEX trading is instantaneous so long as there is sufficient liquidity.</li><li><em>Cost-Efficient</em> – Many DEXs have minimal trading fees, allowing users to swap assets at little to no cost</li><li><em>Globally Accessible</em> – Most DEXs do not require any sign-ups, and largely come with no counterparty risk.</li><li><em>Intuitive</em> – Newer trends have evolved DEX trading from order books to simple point and click swaps.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>DEXes are definitely one of the blockchain trends in 2021, as the traffic and trading volume of existing providers is increasing month by month and people are starting to look for new options for trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>NFTs — Non-Fungible Tokens</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2965\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-300x169.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-768x432.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-2.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-Fungible Tokens are on the rise and quickly gaining popularity across games, art, and music digital asset exchanges, and blockchain platforms. NFTs enable digital scarcity, meaning a single copy of a unique digital asset can be stored within an NFT and can’t be replicated. NFTs were originally popularized by the game Crypto Kitties but since then many <a href=\"https://hack.bg/blog/blockchain-nfts-in-art/\" class=\"rank-math-link\">digital art projects</a> and startups have established themselves in the NFTs world. In-game assets can be digitized and exchanged using NFTs, the same applies to music and audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital rights management is definitely another space which is set for disruption using non fungible tokens.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Tokenization of bonds — STOs</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>STOs are a type of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_offering\" class=\"rank-math-link\">public offering</a> in which tokenized digital securities, known as security tokens, are sold in cryptocurrency exchanges, or security token exchanges. Tokens can be used to trade real financial assets such as equities and fixed income. After crypto-tokens, security tokens are something to look at in 2021 because they are fully regulated and represent digital assets that comply with securities regulators&#8217; basic regulations. The offerings are securities that have been approved by the authorities and are therefore also subject to the prospectus requirement, which must clearly state the funding objective. This is because they involve financing rounds in which equity or debt capital is to be generated. They may be carried out by any company that complies with securities regulations. STOs, give the buyers a share of the company’s profits in return for the loan they extend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to traditional investments, however, STOs offer significantly higher returns and interest rates, making them particularly attractive to investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The immense potential for the next few years is likely to lie in the fact that STOs do not require intermediaries&#8217; assistance. The much leaner structure, therefore, offers greater profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) have recently emerged as a hot topic in the financial space. Banks, Institutions, and governments are performing research and analysis on the economic and technical feasibility of introducing a new form of digital money and its impact on monetary and fiscal policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Bank of International Settlements <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/bispap107.htm\" class=\"rank-math-link\">report</a> states that over 80% of central banks are already researching CBDC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are even countries that experimenting with CBDCs.:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The People&#8217;s Bank of China is one of the first central banks to develop a CBDC. They deployed a special task force in 2014 to research and implement a digital Yuan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, the world&#8217;s oldest bank, Swedish Riksbank, began its CBDC project called e-krona. In 2019, the Bahamas also began their CBDC project called &#8220;Sand Dollar&#8221; — it was fully deployed in October 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, the Republic of the Marshall Islands shared plans for launching a CBDC called Sovereign (SOV).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are still many uncertainties concerning control, liquidity, and more, central bank money is definitely one of the Blockchain Trends in 2021 because it is only a matter of time before digital money becomes mass adoption.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of the important trends one can watch out for in the coming years. From making a food supply chain safer and smarter to transforming legacy processes, blockchain leaders are leading the business world into a new era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The future of distributed ledger technology and blockchain is rapidly changing. Mainstream adoption of blockchain is surely coming and we will see continued interest from, both the consumer and enterprise levels around the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of what happens in 2021,&nbsp; be sure to hold on tight because it is going to be a wild year and one for the books.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Blockchain technology has to be one of the biggest innovations of the past decade.
