One of them being the introduction of central point of failure – if the server hosting the database is inaccessible for some reason (power outage or network issues) our application won’t be accessible at least for the time-frame being offline. There are lots of infrastructure architectures of course that can solve this issue as introducing load balancing and distributed database systems but these approaches also come at a price (consuming too much time, effort and money).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another problem of the centralized systems is trust – do we trust the operator/third-party-service-provider for the correctness of the information stored and provided back. Given the fact that we don’t have access to the database there is no way we can be certain how trustworthy is the provided information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to add here that the traditional approach of building applications is probably the better one for some systems and certain business use-cases. But when we are developing systems that are dealing with value transfers or there is lack of trust between the parties – decentralized applications comes to be the better choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Decentralized Applications</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized applications are aiming to address all of the issues outlined above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized Applications (dApps) are built on top of blockchain networks using smart contracts and are solving problems present in traditional web applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often called application layer solutions &#8211; the decentralized applications are leveraging the features of blockchain technology for providing trust, transparency, immutability and uptime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently there are few types of decentralized applications:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>decentralized applications that manage money &#8211; this is the category for financial applications, providing users with more powerful ways of managing their money</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/decentralized_app_1.png\" alt=\"Decentralized Applications that manage money\" class=\"wp-image-1324\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>semi-financial decentralized applications, where money is involved but there is also a heavy non-monetary side to what is being done</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/decentralized_app_2.png\" alt=\"Decentralized Applications\" class=\"wp-image-1321\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&#8220;other&#8221; decentralized applications &#8211; which include governance, voting and apps that are not financial at all.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/decentralized_app_3.png\" alt=\"DAO Decentralized Applications \" class=\"wp-image-1318\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Our expertise with Decentralized Applications Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team has a broad technical know-how and extensive experience building and designing decentralized applications, components, smart contracts and protocols.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We consult and help enterprises and startups implement blockchain technology, making sure that your decentralized application is running smoothly while you are taking care of your business and customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can help with consulting, blockchain architecture design, smart contracts development, and security auditing when you need help implementing your business logic in a decentralized application, and storage in a decentralized way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We offer comprehensive combination of our know-how, expert interaction and support, to help you with the fulfillment of your business goals.</p>\n","id":"1162","parent":56,"tags":[]}},"context":{"path":"/pages/decentralized-applications-development"}}
