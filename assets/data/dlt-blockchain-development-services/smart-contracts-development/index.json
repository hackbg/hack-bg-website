This code is and the agreement is distributed across the whole decentralized blockchain network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts allow executing trusted transactions and agreements, between anonymous parties, without the need of a central authority, trusted third party, middlemen, legal system or another external enforcement mechanism. Stored on a blockchain network, transactions are rendered transparent, traceable and irreversible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts can find their use case in a large portion of our every-day life. They can be used for storing patent records, ownership and verification of digital assets, exchanging value (money), shares, data, property or anything else in a transparent way without involving third-party services like a middleman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relying on a smart contract to execute a transaction is much quicker compared to the real-world contracts, which require man-hours for paperwork and. documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart_contracts_hack-1024x597.png\" alt=\"Smart Contract Development\" class=\"wp-image-1020\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart_contracts_hack-1024x597.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart_contracts_hack-300x175.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart_contracts_hack-768x448.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart_contracts_hack-987x576.png 987w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart_contracts_hack.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Smart contract Lifecycle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Key take aways</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts contains the following characteristics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Self-executable and auto-enforcing &#8211; as agreement terms are stored in the code, the smart contract automatically enforces the execution of the rules after being triggered by action from parties involved</li><li>Immutable &#8211; being stored on a blockchain they are immutable and </li><li>Verifiable and Safe &#8211;  the code is transparent and can be verified and it is cryptographically safe  </li><li>Cost saving &#8211; removing intermediaries leads to saving costs and fees</li><li>Speed &#8211; smart contracts can be used for automating business tasks, thus saving hours of paperwork</li><li>Autonomy &#8211; removes the need of third parties or escrow/broker agents</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-16\"><strong>How can we help you?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are providing full-stack smart contracts development, auditing, and consulting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you are wondering how smart contracts can help your business, or you are just curious about their potential, use-cases and capabilities and you need expert advice, development or consulting &#8211; our services are just what you need. </p>\n","id":"753","parent":56,"tags":[]}},"context":{"path":"/pages/smart-contracts-development"}}
