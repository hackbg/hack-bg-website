This code is and the agreement is distributed across the whole decentralized blockchain network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts allow executing trusted transactions and agreements, between anonymous parties, without the need of a central authority, trusted third party, middlemen, legal system or another external enforcement mechanism. Stored on a blockchain network, transactions are rendered transparent, traceable and irreversible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts can find their use case in a large portion of our every-day life. They can be used for storing patent records, ownership and verification of digital assets, exchanging value (money), shares, data, property or anything else in a transparent way without involving third-party services like a middleman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Relying on a smart contract to execute a transaction is much quicker compared to the real-world contracts, which require man-hours for paperwork and. documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart_contracts_hack-1024x597.png\" alt=\"Smart Contract Development\" class=\"wp-image-1020\" srcset=\"https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart_contracts_hack-1024x597.png 1024w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart_contracts_hack-300x175.png 300w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart_contracts_hack-768x448.png 768w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart_contracts_hack-987x576.png 987w, https://hack.bg/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/smart_contracts_hack.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption>Smart contract Lifecycle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Key take aways</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Smart contracts contains the following characteristics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Self-executable and auto-enforcing &#8211; as agreement terms are stored in the code, the smart contract automatically enforces the execution of the rules after being triggered by action from parties involved</li><li>Immutable &#8211; being stored on a blockchain they are immutable and </li><li>Verifiable and Safe &#8211;  the code is transparent and can be verified and it is cryptographically safe  </li><li>Cost saving &#8211; removing intermediaries leads to saving costs and fees</li><li>Speed &#8211; smart contracts can be used for automating business tasks, thus saving hours of paperwork</li><li>Autonomy &#8211; removes the need of third parties or escrow/broker agents</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"mntl-sc-block_1-0-16\"><strong>How can we help you?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We are providing full-stack smart contracts development, auditing, and consulting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you are wondering how smart contracts can help your business, or you are just curious about their potential, use-cases and capabilities and you need expert advice, development or consulting &#8211; our services are just what you need. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><em><strong>Questions &amp; Answers?</strong></em></h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1626098982381\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>What Is a Smart Contract?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \"><p>In general, contracts are agreement papers that have a set of terms and conditions that clearly define how to process a transaction, and outlines the role and responsibilities of the parties involved in it. If you replace the same terms and conditions in a traditional contract with lines of codes that self-execute when certain conditions are met, you’ll have a smart contract.</p>\n<p>In other words, a smart contract is an agreement between two people in the form of computer code that is run on the blockchain, so it is stored on a public database and cannot be changed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1626099003593\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>How do smart contracts work?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \"><p>First, as in a traditional contract, the contractual parties should determine the terms of the contract. Since this is a “smart” contract, after the contractual terms are finalized, they are translated into programming code, created with the help of Ethereum, which is a popular Blockchain platform and programming languages such as Solidity, Python or GoLang.<br />Basically, the code represents a number of different conditional statements that describe the possible scenarios of a future transaction that works on a condition-based principle IF-WHEN-THEN. There is no limit to the conditions one can include in a Smart Contract. And, it’s only when these set of conditions are successfully met, the Smart Contracts would execute and validate a transaction.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1626099019361\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>What problems do smart contracts solve?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \"><p>Smart contracts have the ability to solve some really fundamental problems regarding the trust, transparency and accuracy difficulties in traditional smart contracts systems. Here is a list of problems that smart contracts solve :</p>\n<p><strong>Speed, efficiency and accuracy &#8211;</strong> Because smart contracts are digital and automated, there’s no paperwork to process and no time spent reconciling errors that often result from manually filling in documents.</p>\n<p><strong>Trust and transparency &#8211; </strong>Because there’s no third party involved, and because encrypted records of transactions are shared across participants, there’s no need to question whether information has been altered for personal benefit.</p>\n<p><strong>Security &#8211; </strong>Blockchain transaction records are encrypted, which makes them very hard to foul play.</p>\n<p><strong>Savings &#8211; </strong>Without the need to involve any third-party, middlemen or intermediary, individuals and businesses would be able to significantly reduce operational and transactional costs. Thus, saving a lot of money in return.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1626099063419\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h3 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>What industries use smart contracts?</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \"><p>Smart contracts come with many benefits like speed, efficiency, accuracy, trust and transparency and security. There are many industries that can implement these benefits to optimize their internal processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Here is a list of industries that can use smart contracts:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Insurance  &#8211; </strong>With Smart Contracts, an insurance company can automate the claim process by defining terms and conditions or setting pre-agreed parameters that will help companies improve customer relationship and trust.</p>\n<p><strong>Supply Chain</strong> &#8211; Supply chain can use smart contracts to streamline supply chain processes, track inventory, manage invoices and reports to monitor compliance. Thus, leading to reducing fraud and costs.</p>\n<p><strong>Real Estate</strong>  &#8211; with smart contracts one can easily create agreements(renting, buying or selling) and make transactions all without paying a dime to brokers, middlemen or real estate agents.</p>\n<p><strong>Health Systems &#8211; </strong>Medical and healthcare industry can use smart contract to access patient identity and cross-institutional data, therefore providing better medical services.</p>\n<p><strong>Management &#8211; </strong>Smart Contracts can help with smooth business management and seamless workflow within an organization.</p>\n<p><strong>Banking &#8211; </strong>From loans and payments to online identity management and other financial operations, Smart Contracts can help streamline various processes safely and securely.</p>\n<p><strong>Government &#8211; </strong>One area where smart contracts can be a great aid for the government is the overhauling of the Voting systems.</p>\n<p><strong>Charity &#8211; </strong>Smart contracts could make charities more accountable and increase trust among supporters.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","id":"753","parent":56,"excerpt":"<p>One of the key social and economic problems that blockchain solves is that, it removes the need to use and [&hellip;]</p>\n","link":"https://hack.bg/dlt-blockchain-development-services/smart-contracts-development/","modified":"2021-07-12T17:14:41","featuredMedia":null,"tags":[]}},"context":{"path":"/pages/smart-contracts-development"}}
